1.0 Introduction

 AsmFile is a general file manager.  It is similiar
 to the "mc" file manager.

1.1 Purpose

 AsmFile was written in assembler for small size and speed.
 It uses common Linux utilities to handle much of the
 work and uses tables to select utilites and adjust displayed
 buttons.

1.2 Overview

  The AsmFile window looks like this:
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 The middle buttons are file related and work on the highlighted file.
 For move or copy operatons the higlighted file/directory is moved to
 directory shown in oposing panel.

 The bottom line is always available for shell commands.

 the top row of buttons are user defined.  The defaults are
 setup to create an ide for assembler.  All top buttons are
 attached to external programs or scripts.


2.0 Program Inputs

 When first loaded, AsmFile looks for paths on the command
 line and if not found it used the $HOME directory.
 AsmFile can accept paths for the two windows.

 Another somewhat invisible input is from a collection of
 files that configure the program and control how it reacts
 to user input.  These files can describe projects, buttons,
 button actions, and other parameters.


3.0 Usage

 The mouse is active in all windows (if AsmFile is executed in
 an xterm).  In console mode,  the keyboard is used.  In most
 menu's the up/down arrow keys followed by enter, will select
 options.  Escape or ctrl-O can be used to exit most windows.

3.1 Mouse_use

 All buttons can be selected by mouse clicks.  The right/left
 pannels can be activated by mouse clicks and once selected
 individual files can be highlighted.

 Right clicks on top button row will convert button into
 a bookmark using currently active directory.

3.2 Top_buttons

 The top buttons can be configured with "setup" as either
 functions or bookmarks.  A bookmark label has to start
 with the "/" character and functions can be any executable.
 All top buttons result in execution of a shell command.

 Since some of the buttons call scripts it is easy to change
 the way they operate.  Each top button executable recieves
 the selected right/left window entries as parameters.

 The default top buttons are:
   
   QUIT - exit asmfile
   SETUP - adjust settings
   HELP - display this help file
   SPELL - spell check if ispell or aspell installed
   TODO - todo  manager if AsmPlan installed.

 Bookmark buttons have a short cut feature that sets the
 current directory to bookmark.  Simply right-click on
 a top line button and it becomes a bookmark.

3.3 Vertical_buttons

3.3.1 status

 The status button brings up a table showing the
 status of current highlighted entry.  It also allows
 attributes and owners to be changed.

3.3.2 open

 The open button works on highlighted entry.  If a
 directory is highlighted, it is entered.  If a file
 is highlighted it is decoded using a table of
 instructions (see setup function to edit table).
 If the file is an executable it will be executed.

3.3.3 view

 the view button works on highlighted entry.  It
 will try to determine viewing options using a
 table of instructions. (see setup button to
 edit table).

3.3.4 edit

 The edit button starts an editor on the currently
 highlighted file.  The default editor can be selected
 from the setup button.

3.3.5 copy

 Copy transfers files/directories from on pannel to
 the other.  An option to change names occures before
 the copy.

3.3.6 move

 Move will move files and directories and rename
 them.  To rename anything set both pannels to the
 same location an use move with name change.

3.3.7 makedir
 
 Not much to say here.

3.3.8 delete

 Delete is a very dangerous button.  Beware, it does
 not ask first.

3.3.9 expand

 Expand knows about most compression types and expands
 them.

3.3.10 tar.gz

 Tar.gz makes compressed files in only one format. 

3.3.11 compar

 Compare will compare the two text files in right
 and left pannels.  It uses an external program to
 do this which can be changed by editing the compar
 script.  Initially AsmFile expects the program
 xxdiff to be available and does nothing if not found.

3.3.12 print

 Print needs to be setup for your printer.  It is
 currently setup for a deskjet 500 which may not
 be ideal.  The print script can be edited to
 change its operation.

3.4 Terminal Button

 The terminal button can be used to check on the results
 of AsmFile shell commands or work in the shell.  Once in
 the shell it is necessary to type "exit" to leave.

 Another way to enter and leave the terminal is with the
 ctrl-o key.  This is easy to remember since it is used
 to exit many commands that call terminal programs.

3.5 Terminal Entry Line

 The terminal entry line accepts all alpha characters typed.
 Pressing <return> will execute the line.  Note: if no
 characters have been typed, the <return> key is connected
 to the open button.

 The highlighted file can be inserted into a terminal command
 by entering "%f".  For example: to edit the current file with
 vi type:
  
     vi %f <enter>

 Note: Since typing <Enter> can execute a highlighted program
 or run data on the terminal it is necessary to keep AsmFile
 informed about which is needed.  To help with this the terminal
 line is highlighted whenever AsmFile thinks it is being used
 to enter commands.  To get out of the entry mode, type ESC or
 any non-alpha key.

3.6 Keyboard_use

  ctrl-x      -  exit
  alt-x       -  exit
  alt-q       -  exit

  tab    - switch pannels

  ctrl-o - swith to and from the terminal display

  right/left
  arrow keys - traverse directory tree

  up/down
  arrow keys - traverse up/down file list

  pgup/pgdn  - page up down file selection pannel

  enter - same as open button

  ESC,q,ctrl-o are all used to exit helper programs
  run by AsmFile.  A few helper programs require other
  keys to exit and for these programs crtl-c always
  works.  For example the "less" viewer is run when
  the F3 key is pressed.  Normally, "less" uses the
  'q' key to exit.  AsmFile also recognizes ESC, F3,
  and crtl-c as exit keys.

  all other keys are show on buttons and usage is
  obvious.

4.0 Installation.

  The command "make install" as "root" can be used to
  install any AsmFileE package.  Normally, it isn't
  necessary to do a compile. uninstalled with:

     "make uninstall"

5.0 Configuration

  The "setup" button can be used to edit the
  configuration files and change AsmFile operation.
  
  Access button  file name        Description
  -------------  --------------   ------------------------
  setup          configf.tbl       general settings
  setup          top_buttonsf.tbl  defines buttons on top row
  setup          open_buttonf.tbl  defines open button action
  setup          view_buttonf.tbl  defines view button action

  The top row buttons can also be bookmarks which are
  set from the "setup" button or right click.

6.0 Design

  AsmFile is written in assembler but calls numerous
  common system programs.  Unfortunatly, it is not
  portable beyond Linux x86 systems.

  Most of the code is from AsmLib and was created with
  AsmEdit.

  The code is not optimized and could be shrunk by at
  least 50%.


program flow
------------

  * open library
  * parse input line and save
  * if first time check if directory structure setup.
  *   if directory missing, exit and display error msg
  *   else - verify project directory and files copied by config.
  * compute window demensions
  * display window
  *   display_buttons
  *   display_mid_buttons
  *   display_inactive_window
  *   display_status_line
  *   display_active_window
  *   display_term_line ; waits for input
  
  * if new project button press, present table of options
    assembler - project name - 
  * copy files and check if assembler avail.  check other
    tools.
