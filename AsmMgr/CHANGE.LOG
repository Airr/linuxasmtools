2005-03-12 fixed problem with highlighting selector bar
           when it is outside window or in wrong page

2005-03-12 Added highlight to executable files

2005-03-13 Fixed problem with positioning select bar
           after deleting in a directory with 2 entries

2005-03-13 Fixed reading the dents for large directores
           by modifing the library call to read until
           a zero status is returned

2005-03-13 Recoded command line entry to give feedback when
           string is being entered and hold data if other
           command are executed.

2005-03-13 Fixed parse to halt and report bad paths entred

2005-03-13 Changed ESC key while in command line entry to
           reset data.  Changed AsmMgr esc key to null action

2005-04-15 Changed command line to non-warp function so the
           program "kate" will run.

2005-04-15 Fixed problem in library with str_compare.  Added
           new compare called str_match which works with
           find_env_variable.

2005-06-19 Removed exit using the "space" key

2005-06-19 Removed project key

2005-06-19 Modified makefile to install at /usr/bin and
           /usr/share/asmmgr.  Temp files go to /tmp

2005-06-19 Modified shell command entry so it does not use
           arrow keys and they are available as menu keys.

2005-06-19 Modified window and shell commands to use normal
           screen for shell functions and alt screen to main
           program.  The wrap logic was removed and only a
           simple shell is used.

2005-06-19 Fixed problem with running two copies of asmmgr.
           The files stored at /tmp are now unique for each
           asmmgr executable.

2005-07-19 Fixed problem of trying to enter socket as it it
           was a directory.  Fix was to change logic in dir_type
           to set default type as "file"

2005-07-19 Fixed problem with status line showing two "//" after
           visiting the root "/".  The routine dir_fwd now checks
           if we are root and avoids storing the '/'

2005-08-27 put quotes around the %f substitution field in terminal.
           This allows files with embedded spaces to be handled.

2005-08-27 Added quotes to f3,f1,f8 commands to allow files
           with embedded spaces to be deleted, viewed, and status checked

2005-08-28 Revised find command results viewing to allow "esc" as
           exit key.  

2005-08-28 Added "esc" option to view_table which enables the escape
           key as a trigger key.  This allows us to use escape to
           exit the "less" program.  The f3 and ctrl-o options still
           work also.

2005-08-30 Fixed ctrl-o to re-read directories when returning to
           the asmmgr menu mode.

2005-08-31 Add right-click function for top buttons.  Any button
           right clicked will become a bookmark for current directory.

2005-09-01 Fixed problem trying to enter directory that can not be
           accessed.  the logic at dir_fwd was changed from a dir_change
           to read access check.

2005-09-01 Fixed problem if view button (f3) is used inside an
           empty directory.  Checked for nul directory in move_fname

2005-09-13 Fixed problem with creating bookmark with right click.
           directory names shorter than 5 characters failed.

2005-10-10 Fixed segfault when huge directories entered.  This
           occured on knoppix /dev and /usr/share/doc directories.
           Fix was to increase size of sort_pointers buffer.

2005-11-18 Fixed problems with symlinks in /dev directory.  The
           status line was wrong and right arrow into sym link was
           disabled.

2005-12-20 Fixed problem with viewing results of "find" command.
           The pgup/pgdn keys did not work because shell_feed_watch
           did not decode key table correctly.

2005-12-22 The alt-x keys for bookmarks, set the bookmark instead
           of going to directory.  This was fixed by adding test
           lookup_process.

2006-01-08 Fixed problems with display settings at exit and
           when other programs are exited.
           on exit - reset terminal with 1bh,"c",0
           in fprocess - reset terminal as above
           before executing command on command line, do reset terminal
           before switching to console, reset attributes with 0fh,1bh,"[0m",0

2006-02-01 Changed all launch operations to ignore the return
           code and not pause if error.  This involved removing
           ignore_error_flag, and error_pause

2006-02-02 Fixed a problem introduced with changes to handle symlinks.
           The dir_bak key failed after switching windows with tab.
           It was caused by "symlink_flag" being set in dir_fwd code.

2006-02-03 Changed handling of errors from external programs run
           by asmmgr.  The status line now displays their return
           code.  Changes were made to program fprocess and the
           internal "launch" program to pass errors on and build
           message.  Every program that called launch was changed
           to set the "40h" bit it cmd_status so pre-built return
           message is displayed.

2006-02-03 The F11 file compare function failed in files were in
           different directories.  This was fixed by switching
           windows and picking up files for other window.

2006-02-12 Fixed two problems with project setup.  The selection
           of project directory used <enter> as right-arrow if
           directory was selected.  It was changed back to a
           selection key
           Also, the sample programs failed because of a bug in
           the Linux kernel which requires a program have a
           .data section.  The fix was to add a .data section.

2008-01-10 Changed file_write_open to force umask.  This insures
          the /tmp/right.0 file will have permissions of 666q.
          Otherwise root asmmgr can create files only accessable
          as root.
