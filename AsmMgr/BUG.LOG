Current bugs:

* Running "kate" from command line, results in screwed
  up display?  It appears to be a timing problem.
  See comments in listing.

* Trying to enter protected directory (/tmp/kde-root) causes
  asmmgr to abort.

* symbolic links for directores/files are not shown on
  status line as destination.

* Long file names with embedded spaces are not processed
  by the F3 and F4 commands.  For example, mp3 files are
  not always played if filename is incorrect.
