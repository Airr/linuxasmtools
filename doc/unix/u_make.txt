 make - use rules to create programs

the "make" program is very good at automating
program compiles, but requires some setup.
AsmTools come with some universal make files
that eliminate the setup process.  Also the
"project" program sets up a directory with
a standard makefile.

When "make" is typed, the make program starts
and looks in the current directory for its
control file.  Normally this file is called

  Makefile

Within Makefile is a list of actions which
can be performed.  These actions can be
added as parameters to "make" as follows:

  make <program-name>
  make install
  make uninstall

For novice programmers it will be easiest
to use the standard Makefile found in
AsmTools and type "make" to compile programs
using nasm.  This uses the default state
for compile and works with AsmMgr and
other programs.
