 gcc - GNU compilers

gcc tries to guess what the user wants and can be
confusing.  It calls preprocessors, compilers and
the linker depending upon what parameters look like.
For standard "c" programs the following usually
produces an executable file:

  gcc <input-file> -o <output-file>

For assembler we don't want the library wrappers
around our program and need to specify:

  -nostartfiles

Also we sometimes want to see the "as" assembler
output.  This requires the -S control.

  -S
