 ld - GNU linker

The linker converts objects to executables.  It has
a large number of options, but the general format is:

  ld <input-obj> flags -o <output-file> <libraries/objects>

To link a program called "foo"

  ld foo.o -o foo 

Libraries can be appended with full path or additional
object files in the current directory.  Another useful
control is "-e".  This sets the entry address if the
standard "_start" isn't used.  For example:

  ld foo.o -e _start -o foo /usr/lib/asmlib.a
