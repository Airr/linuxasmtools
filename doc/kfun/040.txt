ERRORS
       EPERM  The filesystem containing pathname does not support the  removal
              of directories.

       EFAULT pathname points outside your accessible address space.

       EACCES Write  access  to  the  directory  containing  pathname  was not
              allowed for the process's effective uid, or one of the  directo-
              ries in pathname did not allow search (execute) permission.

       EPERM  The  directory  containing pathname has the sticky-bit (S_ISVTX)
              set and the process's effective uid is neither the  uid  of  the
              file to be deleted nor that of the directory containing it.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              pathname was too long.

       ENOENT A  directory  component  in pathname does not exist or is a dan-
              gling symbolic link.

       ENOTDIR
              pathname, or a component used as a  directory  in  pathname,  is
              not, in fact, a directory.

       ENOTEMPTY
              pathname contains entries other than . and .. .

       EINVAL pathname has .  as last component.

       EBUSY  pathname  is  the current working directory or root directory of
              some process.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       EROFS  pathname refers to a file on a read-only filesystem.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving  pathname.
