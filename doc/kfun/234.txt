DESCRIPTION
       Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes (files,
       directories, symbolic links, etc).  They are extensions to  the  normal
       attributes  which  are  associated with all inodes in the system (i.e.,
       the stat(2) data).  A complete overview of extended attributes concepts
       can be found in attr(5).

       listxattr()  retrieves  the list of extended attribute names associated
       with the given path in the filesystem.  The list is the set  of  (null-
       terminated)  names,  one after the other.  Names of extended attributes
       to which the calling process does not have access may be  omitted  from
       the list.  The length of the attribute name list is returned.

       llistxattr()  is identical to listxattr(), except in the case of a sym‐
       bolic link, where the list of names of extended  attributes  associated
       with the link itself is retrieved, not the file that it refers to.

       flistxattr() is identical to listxattr(), only the open file pointed to
       by filedes (as returned by open(2)) is interrogated in place of path.

       A single extended attribute name is a  simple  null-terminated  string.
       The  name  includes  a namespace prefix; there may be several, disjoint
       namespaces associated with an individual inode.

       An empty buffer of size zero can be passed into these calls  to  return
       the  current size of the list of extended attribute names, which can be
       used to estimate the size of a buffer which is  sufficiently  large  to
       hold the list of names.

   Example
       The  list of names is returned as an unordered array of null-terminated
       character strings (attribute names are separated by null bytes (’\0’)),
       like this:

              user.name1\0system.name1\0user.name2\0

       Filesystems  like  ext2,  ext3 and XFS which implement POSIX ACLs using
       extended attributes, might return a list like this:

              system.posix_acl_access\0system.posix_acl_default\0

RETURN VALUE
       On success, a positive number is returned indicating the  size  of  the
       extended attribute name list.  On failure a negative code is returned

       If the size of the list buffer is too small to hold the  result,  errno
       is set to ERANGE.

       If extended attributes are not supported by the filesystem, or are dis‐
       abled, errno is set to ENOTSUP.

       The errors documented for the stat(2) system call are  also  applicable
       here.

VERSIONS
       These system calls have been available on Linux since kernel 2.4; glibc
       support is provided since version 2.3.

CONFORMING TO
       These system calls are Linux specific.
