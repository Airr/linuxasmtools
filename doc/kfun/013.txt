 13 time           - get time in seconds since 1-jan-1970
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov  eax,013
  mov  ebx,tloc   ;either ptr or null to return time in eax only
  int  80h

       time returns the time since the Epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970),
       measured in seconds in eax.

       If tloc is non-NULL, the return value is also stored in the memory pointed
       to by tloc.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  the value of time in seconds since the Epoch is returned.
       On error eax is set to negative error code

ERRORS
       EFAULT tloc points outside your accessible address space.

NOTES
       POSIX.1 defines seconds since the Epoch as a value to be interpreted as
       the number of seconds between a specified time and the Epoch, according
       to a formula for conversion from UTC equivalent to  conversion  on  the
       naïve  basis that leap seconds are ignored and all years divisible by 4
       are leap years.  This value is not the same as  the  actual  number  of
       seconds  between  the  time  and the Epoch, because of leap seconds and
       because clocks are not required to be synchronised to a standard refer-
       ence.   The  intention  is that the interpretation of seconds since the
       Epoch values be consistent; see  POSIX.1  Annex  B  2.2.2  for  further
       rationale.
