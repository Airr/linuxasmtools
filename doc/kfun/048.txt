  (use the sigaction call instead)

  The linux.signal() system call installs a new signal handler for the
  signal number signum. The signal handler is set to sighandler
  which may be a user specified function, or either signals.sig_ign or
  signals.sig_dfl.

  Upon arrival of a signal with number signum the following happens. If
  the corresponding handler is set to signals.sig_ign, then the signal is
  ignored. If the handler is set to signals.sig_dfl, then the default
  action associated to the signal (see signal(7)) occurs. Finally, if the
  handler is set to a function sighandler then first either the handler is
  reset to signals.sig_dfl or an implementation-dependent blocking of the
  signal is per- formed and next sighandler is called with argument signum.
  Using a signal handler function for a signal is called "catching the
  signal". The signals signals.sigkill and signals.sigstop cannot be
  caught or ignored.

 return value --
  The function signal() returns the previous value of the signal handler,
  or signals.sig_err on error.
