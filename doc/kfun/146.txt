146 writev         - write a list of buffers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov  eax,146
  mov  ebx,fd     ;open file descriptor
  mov  ecx,vector ;ptr to iovec (buffer list)
  mov  edx,count  ;number of buffers
  int  80h

       The writev() function writes at most count blocks described  by  vector
       to the file associated with the file descriptor fd.

       The pointer vector points to a struct iovec defined in sys/uio.h as

          struct iovec
              .iov_base resd 1 ;buffer address
              .iov_len  resd 1 ;size of buffer
          endstruc

       Buffers are processed in the order specified.

       The writev() function works just like  "write"  except  that  multiple
       buffers are written out.


RETURN VALUE
       On  success, the writev() function returns the number of bytes written.
       On error a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       The  errors  are  as  given for "write".  Additionally the
       following error is defined.

       EINVAL The sum of the iov_len values overflows an  ssize_t  value.  Or,
              the vector count count is zero or greater than MAX_IOVEC.

BUGS
       It is not advisable to mix calls to functions like readv() or writev(),
       which operate on file descriptors, with the functions  from  the  stdio
       library;  the results will be undefined and probably not what you want.
