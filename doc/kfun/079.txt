 79 settimeofday   - set time

  mov  eax,079
  mov  ebx,tv   ;ptr to time data
  mov  ecx,tz   ;ptr to time zone data (not used)
  int  80h

       The function settimeofday can set the time.
       The tv argument is a timeval struct, as specified
       in <sys/time.h>:

       struct timeval
               .tv_sec  resd 1 ;  seconds */
               .tv_usec resd 1 ;  microseconds */
       endstric

       and gives the number of seconds and microseconds since the  Epoch  (see
       time).  The tz argument is a timezone :

       struct timezone
               tz_minuteswest resd 1 ; /* minutes W of Greenwich */
               tz_dsttime     resd 1 ;     /* type of dst correction */
       endstruc

       The  use  of  the timezone struct is obsolete; the tz_dsttime field has
       never been used under Linux

       If  either  tv or tz is null, the corresponding structure is not set or
       returned.

       Only the super user may use settimeofday.

RETURN VALUE
       settimeofday return 0 for success, or negative code for  failure

ERRORS
       EPERM  settimeofday is called by someone other than the superuser.

       EINVAL Timezone (or something else) is invalid.

       EFAULT One of tv or tz pointed outside your accessible address space.
