      Up to size supplementary group IDs are returned in list.  It is
      unspecified whether  the  effective  group  ID  of  the  calling
      process  is included in the returned list. (Thus, an application
      should also call getegid(2) and  add  or  remove  the  resulting
      value.)   If  size  is zero, list is not modified, but the total
      number of supplementary group IDs for the process is returned.

RETURN VALUE
      On  success,  the number of supplementary group IDs is returned.
      On error, a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EINVAL size is less than the number of supple-
              mentary group IDs, but is not zero.

NOTES
       A  process  can have up to at least NGROUPS_MAX supplementary group IDs
       in addition to the effective group ID. The set of  supplementary  group
       IDs  is inherited from the parent process and may be changed using set-
       groups.  The maximum number of supplementary group  IDs  can  be  found
       using sysconf(3):
           long ngroups_max;
           ngroups_max = sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX);
       The  maximal  return  value of getgroups cannot be larger than one more
       than the value obtained this way.
