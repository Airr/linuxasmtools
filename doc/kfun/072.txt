 72 sigsuspend      - temporarily set signal mask
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ; sigsuspend - Temporarily sets the signal mask (as specified)
  ; and then suspends the process pending a signal.
  mov  eax,072
  mov  edx,mask	 <- pointer to temporary mask
  int  80h

  The sigsuspend call  temporarily  replaces  the  signal  mask  for  the
  process  with  that given by mask and then suspends the process until a
  signal is received.

  If the signal terminates the process, then assessing does not return.
  If the signal is caught, then sys_sigsuspend returns after the signal
  handler returns, and the signal mask is restored to the state before
  the call to sys_sigsuspend.

  Normally, sys_sigsuspend is used in conjunction with
  sys_sigprocmask in order to prevent delivery of a signal during the
  execution of a critical code section. The caller first blocks the
  signals with sys_sigprocmask. When the critical code has completed,
  the caller then waits for the signals by calling sys_sigsuspend with
  the signal mask that was returned by sys_sigprocmask.


  Return value is always -ERESTARTNOHAND.
