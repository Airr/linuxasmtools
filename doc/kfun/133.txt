       chdir changes the current directory to that specified by "fd".
       fd is an open file descriptor.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       Depending  on  the file system, other errors can be returned.  The more
       general errors for chdir are listed below:

       EFAULT path points outside your accessible address space.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of path.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving path.

       EIO    An I/O error occurred.

       The general errors for fchdir are listed below:

       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EACCES Search permission was denied on the directory open on fd.

NOTES
       The prototype for fchdir is only available if  _BSD_SOURCE  is  defined
       (either  explicitly,  or  implicitly,  by not defining _POSIX_SOURCE or
       compiling with the -ansi flag).

CONFORMING TO
       The chdir call is compatible with SVr4, SVID,  POSIX,  X/OPEN,  4.4BSD.
       SVr4  documents  additional  EINTR, ENOLINK, and EMULTIHOP error condi-
       tions but has no ENOMEM.  POSIX.1 does not have ENOMEM or  ELOOP  error
       conditions.   X/OPEN  does  not have EFAULT, ENOMEM or EIO error condi-
       tions.

       The fchdir call is compatible with SVr4, 4.4BSD and X/OPEN.  SVr4 docu-
       ments additional EIO, EINTR, and ENOLINK error conditions.  X/OPEN doc-
       uments additional EINTR and EIO error conditions.
