system 161 sched_rr_get_interval   - get the SCHED_RR interval for the named

       sched_rr_get_interval writes into the timespec structure pointed to  by
       tp  the  round robin time quantum for the process identified by pid. If
       pid is zero, the time quantum for the calling process is  written  into
       *tp. The identified process should be running under the SCHED_RR sched-
       uling policy.

       timspec struc
        .sec  resd 1 ;seconds
        .msec resd 1 ;nanoseconds
       endstruc

       The round robin time quantum value is not alterable under Linux 1.3.81.

       POSIX  systems  on  which  sched_rr_get_interval  is  available  define
       _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING in <unistd.h>.


RETURN VALUE
       On success, sched_rr_get_interval returns 0.  On error a negative code
       is returned

ERRORS
       ESRCH  The process whose ID is pid could not be found.

       ENOSYS The system call is not yet implemented.

       EINVAL Invalid pid.

       EFAULT Problem with copying information to userspace.

BUGS
       As  of  Linux  1.3.81  sched_rr_get_interval returns with error ENOSYS,
       because SCHED_RR has not yet been fully implemented  and  tested  prop-
       erly.
