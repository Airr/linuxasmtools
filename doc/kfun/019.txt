 19 lseek          - reposition read/write file offset
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov  eax,019
  mov  ebx,fd       ;file descriptor
  mov  ecx,offset   ;offset (displacement) into file
  mov  edx,origin   ;flag defining offset type (also known as whence)
  int  80h

       The lseek function repositions the offset of the file (fd)
       as specified by whence

    origin (whence)
    ---------------

       SEEK_SET (0) -The offset from beginning of file
       SEEK_CUR (1) -The offset from current location
       SEEK_END (2) -The offset from end of file

       The lseek function allows the file offset to be set beyond the  end  of
       the existing end-of-file of the file (but this does not change the size
       of the file).  If data is later written at this point, subsequent reads
       of  the  data  in the gap return bytes of zeros (until data is actually
       written into the gap).

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, lseek returns the resulting offset location
       as  measured  in  bytes  from  the beginning of the file.  Otherwise, a
       negative error is returned.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fildes is not an open file descriptor.

       ESPIPE fildes is associated with a pipe, socket, or FIFO.

       EINVAL whence  is  not  one  of  SEEK_SET,  SEEK_CUR,  SEEK_END, or the
              resulting file offset would be negative.

       EOVERFLOW
              The resulting file offset cannot is incorrect

RESTRICTIONS
       Some devices are incapable of seeking and POSIX does not specify  which
       devices must support it.

       Linux  specific  restrictions:  using  lseek  on  a  tty device returns
       ESPIPE.
