  6 close          - close a file descriptor
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov  eax,006
  mov  ebx,fd
  int  80h

       close closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any file
       and may be reused. Any locks held on the file it was  associated  with,
       and  owned by the process, are removed (regardless of the file descrip-
       tor that was used to obtain the lock).

       If fd is the last copy of a particular file  descriptor  the  resources
       associated  with it are freed; if the descriptor was the last reference
       to a file which has been removed using unlink the file is deleted.

RETURN VALUE
       close returns zero on success, or a negative error code.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd isn't a valid open file descriptor.

NOTES
       A  successful  close does not guarantee that the data has been success-
       fully saved to disk, as the kernel defers writes. It is not common  for
       a  filesystem  to  flush  the buffers when the stream is closed. If you
       need to be sure that the data is physically stored use  fsync(2).   (It
       will depend on the disk hardware at this point.)
