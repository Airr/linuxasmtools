  int   80h

       When  called  with the name of an existing file as argument, accounting
       is turned on, records for each terminating process are appended to
       filename as process terminates.  An argument of NULL causes accounting to be
       turned off.

       Only root can utilize this function.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error negative code

ERRORS
       EACCES Write permission is denied for the specified file.

       EACCES The argument filename is not a regular file.

       EFAULT filename points outside your accessible address space.

       EIO    Error writing to the file filename.

       EISDIR filename is a directory.

       ELOOP  Too  many symbolic links were encountered in resolving filename.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              filename was too long.

       ENOENT The specified filename does not exist.

       ENOMEM Out of memory.

       ENOSYS BSD process accounting has not been enabled when  the  operating
              system  kernel was compiled.  The kernel configuration parameter
              controlling this feature is CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT.

       ENOTDIR
              A component used as a directory in filename is  not  in  fact  a
              directory.

       EPERM  The calling process has no permission to enable process account-
              ing.

       EROFS  filename refers to a file on a read-only file system.

       EUSERS There are no more free file structures or we ran out of  memory.

NOTES
       No accounting is produced for programs running when a crash occurs.  In
       particular, nonterminating processes are never accounted for.
