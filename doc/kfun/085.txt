 85 readlink       - read value of a symbolic link
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov  eax,085
  mov  ebx,path     ;ptr to asciiz path
  mov  ecx,buf      ;buffer to hold link path
  mov  edx,bufsize  ;size of buf
  int  80h

       readlink  places  the  contents of the symbolic link path in the buffer
       buf, which has size bufsiz.  readlink does not append a  NUL  character
       to  buf.   It will truncate the contents (to a length of bufsiz charac-
       ters), in case the buffer is too small to hold all of the contents.

RETURN VALUE
       The call returns the count of characters placed in  the  buffer  if  it
       succeeds,  or a negative error code

ERRORS
       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       EINVAL bufsiz is not positive.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              A pathname, or a component of a pathname, was too long.

       ENOENT The named file does not exist.

       EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of the path  prefix.

       ELOOP  Too  many  symbolic  links  were  encountered in translating the
              pathname.

       EINVAL The named file is not a symbolic link.

       EIO    An I/O error occurred while reading from the file system.

       EFAULT buf extends outside the process's allocated address space.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.
