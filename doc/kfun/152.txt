memory 152 mlockall       - disable paging for calling process
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov  eax,152
  mov  ebx,flags
  int  80h

       munlockall reenables paging for all pages mapped into the address space
       of the calling process.

       Memory locks do not stack, i.e., pages which have been  locked  several
       times  by  calls to mlock or mlockall will be unlocked by a single call
       to munlockall.  Pages which are mapped to several locations or by  sev-
       eral processes stay locked into RAM as long as they are locked at least
       at one location or by at least one process.

       On POSIX systems  on  which  mlockall  and  munlockall  are  available,
       _POSIX_MEMLOCK is defined in <unistd.h> .

RETURN VALUE
       On success, munlockall returns zero. On error a negative code is returned
