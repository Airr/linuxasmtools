254 epoll_create   -  open an epoll file descriptor
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  mov  ecx,epfd  ;epoll file descriptor, 'epfd'
  int  80h


SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/epoll.h>

       int epoll_create(int size);

DESCRIPTION
       Open  an  epoll  file  descriptor  by requesting the kernel allocate an
       event backing store dimensioned for size descriptors.  The size is  not
       the  maximum  size  of  the backing store but just a hint to the kernel
       about how to dimension internal structures.  The returned file descrip‐
       tor  will  be used for all the subsequent calls to the epoll interface.
       The file descriptor returned by epoll_create(2) must be closed by using
       close(2).

RETURN VALUE
       When successful, epoll_create(2) returns a non-negative integer identi‐
       fying the descriptor.  When an error occurs, epoll_create returns a
       negative code

ERRORS
       EINVAL size is not positive.

       ENFILE The  system  limit  on  the  total number of open files has been
              reached.

       ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to create the kernel object.

CONFORMING TO
       epoll_create(2) is Linux specific, and was introduced in kernel 2.5.44.
