145 readv          - read data into multiple buffers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov  eax,145

       The  readv()  function reads count blocks from the file associated with
       the file descriptor fd into the multiple buffers described by vector.

       The pointer vector points to a struct iovec defined in sys/uio.h as

          struct iovec
              .iov_base resd 1 ;ptr to buffer
              .iov_len  resd 1 ;number of bytes to read into buffer
          endstruc

       Buffers are processed in the order specified.

       The  readv()  function  works  just  like "read" except that multiple
       buffers are filled.


RETURN VALUE
       On  success, the readv() function returns the number of bytes read; the
       writev() function returns the number of bytes written.  On error a
       negatave code is returned

ERRORS
       The  errors  are  as  given for read and write.  Additionally the
       following error is defined.

       EINVAL The sum of the iov_len values overflows an  ssize_t  value.  Or,
              the vector count count is zero or greater than MAX_IOVEC.
