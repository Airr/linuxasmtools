   Synchronizes a file segment with disk

args
----

 ebx File descriptor of a file to be synchronized.

 ecx Offset of the file range to be synchronized. Synchronization is
   done in units of the system page size: ebx is rounded down to a page
   boundary; (ebx+ecx-1) is rounded up to a page boundary.

 edx Length of the range to be synchronized, in bytes. If edx is zero,
   then all bytes from offset specified by ecx through to the end of file
   are synchronized.

 esi Flag bit-mask. It may include following flags (esi may be 0, if no
   operation is required):

   SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE Wait upon write-out of all pages in the
   specified range that have already been submitted to the device driver
   for write-out before performing any write.
   This can be used after an earlier "SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE or

   SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE" operation to wait for completion of that
   operation, and obtain its result.
   This flag will detect any I/O errors or ENOSPC conditions and will
   return these to the caller.

   SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE Initiate write-out of all dirty pages in the
   specified range which are not presently submitted write-out. This is
   an asynchronous flush-to-disk operation. This is not suitable for data
   integrity operations.

   SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER Wait upon write-out of all pages in the
   range after performing any write.
   This can be used after an earlier "SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE or

   SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE" operation to wait for completion of that
   operation, and obtain its result.
   This flag will detect any I/O errors or ENOSPC conditions and will
   return these to the caller.

   Useful flags combinations:

   SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE or SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE Ensures that all
   pages in the specified range which were dirty when sys_sync_file_range
   was called are placed under write-out. This is a
   start-write-for-data-integrity operation.

   SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE or SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE or

   SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER This is a traditional [1]sys_fdatasync
   operation. It is a write-for-data-integrity operation that will ensure
   that all pages in the specified range which were dirty when
   sys_sync_file_range was called are committed to disk.

   Return values

   If the system call succeeds the return value is 0.
   If the system call fails the return value is one of the following
   errno values:

   -EBADF ebx is not a valid file descriptor
   -EIO I/O error.
   -EINVAL esi specifies an invalid bit; or ecx or edx is invalid.
   -ENOMEM Out of memory.
   -ENOSPC Out of disk space.
   -ESPIPE ebx refers to something other than a regular file, a block
     device, a directory, or a symbolic link.


   sys_sync_file_range does not write out the file's metadata. Therefore,
   unless the application is strictly performing overwrites of
   already-instantiated disk blocks, there are no guarantees that the
   data will be available after a crash.
