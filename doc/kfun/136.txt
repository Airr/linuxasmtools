 136 personality   - set the process execution domain

  int  80h

       Linux  supports different execution domains, or personalities, for each
       process. Among other things, execution domains tell Linux  how  to  map
       signal  numbers into signal actions. The execution domain system allows
       Linux to provide limited support  for  binaries  compiled  under  other
       Unix-like operating systems.

       This  function  will return the current personality when persona equals
       0xffffffff. Otherwise, it will make the execution domain referenced  by
       persona the new execution domain of the current process.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the previous persona is returned. On error a negative code
       is returned

ERRORS
       EINVAL The kernel was unable to change the personality.
