  mov  eax,219
  mov  ebx,start  ;start address for region
  mov  ecx,length ;length of region
  mov  edx,behaviour


  where behaviour can be:

        MADV_NORMAL	0  no further special treatment */
                           read by clusters, results in some read-ahead/-behind.
        MADV_RANDOM	1  expect random page references */
                           read the minimum amount of data on any access.
        MADV_SEQUENTIAL	2  expect sequential page references */
                           aggressively read ahead.
        MADV_WILLNEED	3  will need these pages */
                           notifying the system to read some pages ahead.
        MADV_DONTNEED	4  don't need these pages */
                           kernel can free resources associated with the given range.
 
 Applications can advise how the kernel how should handle paging I/O in given VM area,
 to help the kernel useing appropriate read-ahead and caching techniques. The information
 provided is advisory and, can be safely disregarded by the kernel without affecting the
 correct operation of the application.

ERRORS

   INVAL   start+len < 0, start not page-aligned, "behavior" not valid or,
           application attempting to release locked or shared pages.
   NOMEM   specified addr range not currently mapped or,
           outside address range of the process.
   IO      I/O error while paging in data.
   EBADF   map exists, but area maps not a file.
   EAGAIN  a kernel resource was temporarily unavailable.
