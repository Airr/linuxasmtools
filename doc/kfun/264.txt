SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       int  clock_settime(clockid_t  which_clock,  const struct timespec *set‚Äê
       ting);

     #define CLOCK_REALTIME			0
     #define CLOCK_MONOTONIC			1
     #define CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID		2
     #define CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID		3

     struct timespec {
     	time_t	tv_sec;		/* seconds */
     	long	tv_nsec;	/* nanoseconds */
     };

DESCRIPTION
       clock_settime sets the clock specified by which_clock to the time value
       specified  by  setting.   Time values that are not integer multiples of
       the clock resolution are truncated down.

       The calling process must possess the appropriate capability  (typically
       CAP_SYS_TIME).

       By  definition,  the  CLOCK_MONOTONIC and CLOCK_MONOTONIC_HR clocks can
       not be set.

       To retrieve the current time value of a  given  clock,  see  clock_get‚Ä‚Äê
       time(3).    To   retrieve   the   resolution  of  a  given  clock,  see
       clock_getres(3).

       For a listing of valid clocks, see clock_gettime(3).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, clock_settime returns the value 0 and  sets  the  specified
       clock to the specified time value.

       On  failure, clock_settime returns the value -1 and errno is set appro‚Äê
       priately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT A specified memory address is outside the address range  of  the
              calling process.

       EINVAL The  clock  specified  by which_clock is invalid, the time value
              specified by setting is outside the range for the  given  clock,
              or  the  nanosecond value specified by setting is less than zero
              or greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       ENOSYS The function is not supported on this implementation.

       EPERM  The requesting process does not have the requisite privilege  to
              set the specified clock.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX 1003.1b (formerly POSIX.4) as ammended by POSIX 1003.1j-2000.
