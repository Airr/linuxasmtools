       As of Linux 2.2, the power of the superuser (root) has been partitioned
       into a set of discrete capabilities.  Every process has a set of effec-
       tive  capabilities  identifying which capabilities (if any) it may cur-
       rently exercise.  Every process also has a set of inheritable capabili-
       ties  that  may  be  passed through an execve(2) and a set of permitted
       capabilites that it can make effective or inheritable.

       This function is the raw kernel interface for settng
       capabilities.  Not only are these system calls specific to Linux,
       but the kernel API is likely to change and use of these  functions  (in
       particular  the  format of the cap_user_*_t types) is subject to change
       with each kernel revision.

       The portable interfaces are  cap_set_proc(3)  and  cap_get_proc(3);  if
       possible  you should use those interfaces in applications.  If you wish
       to use the Linux extensions in applications, you should use the easier-
       to-use interfaces capsetp(3) and capgetp(3).

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EINVAL One of the arguments was invalid.

       EPERM  An attempt was made to add a capability to the Permitted set, or
              to set a capability in the Effective or Inheritable sets that is
              not in the Permitted set.

FURTHER INFORMATION
       The portable interface to the capability querying and setting functions
       is provided by the libcap library and is available from here:
