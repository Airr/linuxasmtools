NAME
    timer_gettime - get the time remaining before a POSIX timer expires

SYNOPSIS
    #include <timer.h>

    int timer_gettime(timer_t timer_id, struct itimerspec *setting);

DESCRIPTION
    timer_gettime  gets  both the time remaining before the timer specified
    by timer_id expires and the  interval  between  timer  expirations  and
    stores  the results in setting.  The it_value field of setting contains
    the time remaining until expiration and the it_interval field  contains
    the timer interval.

    If  it_value contains zero after a successful return, then the timer is
    not active.  If it_interval contains zero after  a  successful  return,
    then the timer is not periodic.

RETURN VALUE
    On  success, timer_gettime returns the value 0 and setting contains the
    retrieved values.

    On failure, timer_gettime returns the value -1 and errno is set  appro‚Äê
    priately.

ERRORS
    EFAULT The address specified by setting is outside the address range of
           the calling process.

CONFORMING TO
    POSIX 1003.1b (formerly POSIX.4) as ammended by POSIX 1003.1j-2000.
