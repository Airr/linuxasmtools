  resource
  --------
   ebx It must be one of the following values:
   RUSAGE_SELF     0  - get resource usage for parent process
   RUSAGE_CHILDREN -1 - get resource usage for child processes.


  rlim
  ----
   struc rusage
;   ru_utime            ; user time used
    .ut_sec      rd 1 ; seconds
    .ut_usec     rd 1 ; microseconds
;   ru_stime            ; system time used

RETURN
       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EFAULT rlim or usage points outside the accessible address space.

       EINVAL getrlimit or  setrlimit  is  called  with  a  bad  resource,  or
              getrusage is called with a bad who.

       EPERM  A non-superuser tries to use setrlimit() to increase the soft or
              hard limit above the current hard limit, or a superuser tries to
              increase RLIMIT_NOFILE above the current kernel maximum.

NOTE
       Including <sys/time.h> is not required these days, but increases porta-
       bility.  (Indeed, struct timeval is defined in <sys/time.h>.)

       On Linux, if the disposition of SIGCHLD is  set  to  SIG_IGN  then  the
       resource  usages  of  child processes are automatically included in the
       value returned by RUSAGE_CHILDREN, although POSIX  1003.1-2001  explic-
       itly prohibits this.
