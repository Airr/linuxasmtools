SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <attr/xattr.h>

       int removexattr(const char *path, const char *name);
       int lremovexattr(const char *path, const char *name);
       int fremovexattr(int filedes, const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
       Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes (files,
       directories, symbolic links, etc).  They are extensions to  the  normal
       attributes  which  are  associated with all inodes in the system (i.e.,
       the stat(2) data).  A complete overview of extended attributes concepts
       can be found in attr(5).

       removexattr()  removes  the  extended  attribute identified by name and
       associated with the given path in the filesystem.

       lremovexattr() is identical to removexattr(), except in the case  of  a
       symbolic  link,  where  the extended attribute is removed from the link
       itself, not the file that it refers to.

       fremovexattr()  is  identical  to  removexattr(),  only  the   extended
       attribute  is  removed  from  the  open  file pointed to by filedes (as
       returned by open(2)) in place of path.

       An extended attribute name is a  simple  null-terminated  string.   The
       name includes a namespace prefix; there may be several, disjoint names‐
       paces associated with an individual inode.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On failure a negative code is returned

       If the named attribute does not exist, errno is set to ENOATTR.

       If extended attributes are not supported by the filesystem, or are dis‐
       abled, errno is set to ENOTSUP.

       The errors documented for the stat(2) system call are  also  applicable
       here.

VERSIONS
       These system calls have been available on Linux since kernel 2.4; glibc
       support is provided since version 2.3.

CONFORMING TO
       These system calls are Linux specific.
