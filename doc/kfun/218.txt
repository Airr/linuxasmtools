  returns memory residency status of the pages in the current process's address space in
  range [addr, addr + len]. Status returned in a vector of bytes; l.s. bit of each byte
  is 1 if the referenced page is in memory, otherwise it is zero. Because the state of a
  page can change after testing but, before "mincore" returns, the vector may contain stale
  information. Only locked pages are guaranteed to reside in memory.

ERRORS

  FAULT   vec points to an illegal address.
  INVAL   addr is not a multiple of PAGE_CACHE_SIZE, or len non-positive.
  NOMEM   addr in range [addr, addr + len] invalid for the address space
          of this process or, any pages which are not currently mapped.
  AGAIN   A kernel resource was temporarily unavailable.
