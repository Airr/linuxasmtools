  mov  eax,140
  mov  ebx,fd            ;open file descriptor
  mov  ecx,offet_high    ;high 32 bits of position
  mov  edx,offset_low    ;low 32 bits of position

       The  llseek  function repositions the offset of the file descriptor fd
       to (offset_high<<32) | offset_low bytes relative to  the  beginning  of
       the  file,  the  current  position in the file, or the end of the file,
       depending on whether whence is SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, respec-
       tively.  It returns the resulting file position in the argument result.

       whence values are:

        SEEK_SET	0	/* seek relative to beginning of file */
        SEEK_CUR	1	/* seek relative to current file position */
        SEEK_END	2	/* seek relative to end of file */

        max file size in ext2 was 2Gig in pre-2.4.-kernel.  This function increases
        file size beyond 2gig.  Passing a disp such that filepointer would become
        negative is an error.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, llseek returns 0. Otherwise a negative
       error code.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not an open file descriptor.

       EINVAL whence is invalid.

       EFAULT Problem with copying results to user space.

CONFORMING TO
       This  function  is  Linux-specific,  and should not be used in programs
       intended to be portable.
