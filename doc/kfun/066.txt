 66 setsid         - creates a session and sets the process group ID
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov  eax,066
  int  80h

       setsid()  creates a new session if the calling process is not a process
       group leader.  The calling process is the leader of  the  new  session,
       the  process group leader of the new process group, and has no control-
       ling tty.  The process group ID and session ID of the  calling  process
       are set to the PID of the calling process.  The calling process will be
       the only process in this new process group and in this new session.

RETURN VALUE
       The session ID of the calling process.

ERRORS
       On error, EPERM will be returned.  It  is returned when the process
       group ID of any process equals the PID of the calling process. Thus,
       setsid  fails  if the calling process is already a process group leader.

NOTES
       A  process group leader is a process with process group ID equal to its
       PID. In order to be sure that setsid will succeed, fork and  exit,  and
       have the child do setsid.
