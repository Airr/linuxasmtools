       setresgid  sets  the real group ID, the effective group ID, and the saved
       (effective) group ID of the current process.

       Unprivileged group processes (i.e., processes with each of real, effec-
       tive  and  saved  group  ID  nonzero) may change the real, effective and
       saved group ID, each to one of: the current uid, the  current  effective
       uid or the current saved uid.

       The  super-user  may set real, effective and saved group ID to arbitrary
       values.

       If one of the parameters equals -1,  the  corresponding  value  is  not
       changed.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, zero is returned. On error a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EPERM  The current  process  was  not  privileged  (did  not  have  the
              CAP_SETUID  capability)  and  tried  to  change the IDs is a not
              allowed way.

       EAGAIN uid does not match the current uid and  this  call  would  bring
              that userID over its NPROC rlimit.
