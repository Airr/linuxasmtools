       The  system  call  getdents  reads  several  dirent structures from the
       directory pointed at by fd into the memory area "buf".
       The parameter count is the size of the memory area.

       The dirent structure is declared as follows:

                  dirent struc
                  .d_ino       resd 1 ; inode number */
                  .d_off       resd 1 ; offset to next dirent */
                  .d_reclen    resw 1 ; length of this dirent */
                  .d_name      resb 256 ; file name (null-terminated) */
                  endstruc

       d_ino  is an inode number.  d_off is the distance from the start of the
       directory to the start of the next dirent.  d_reclen  is  the  size  of
       this entire dirent.  d_name is a null-terminated file name.  d_name
       has a max size of 255 characters followed by null termination.

       This call supersedes readdir.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the number of bytes read is returned.  On end of directory,
       0 is returned.  On error a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EBADF  Invalid file descriptor fd.

       EFAULT Argument points outside the calling process's address space.

       EINVAL Result buffer is too small.

       ENOENT No such directory.

       ENOTDIR
              File descriptor does not refer to a directory.
