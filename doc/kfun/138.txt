138 setfsuid       - set user identity used for file system checks
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov eax,138
  mov ebx,fsuid
  int 80h

       The system call setfsuid sets the user ID that the Linux kernel uses to
       check for all accesses to the file system. Normally, the value of fsuid
       will  shadow  the value of the effective user ID. In fact, whenever the
       effective user ID is changed, fsuid will also be  changed  to  the  new
       value of the effective user ID.

       Explicit  calls  to setfsuid and setfsgid are usually only used by pro-
       grams such as the Linux NFS server that need to change  what  user  and
       group  ID is used for file access without a corresponding change in the
       real and effective user and group IDs.  A change in the normal user IDs
       for a program such as the NFS server is a security hole that can expose
       it to unwanted signals. (But see below.)

       setfsuid will only succeed if the caller is the superuser or  if  fsuid
       matches  either the real user ID, effective user ID, saved set-user-ID,
       or the current value of fsuid.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the previous value of fsuid is returned. On error,  the
       current value of fsuid is returned.

CONFORMING TO
       setfsuid  is Linux specific and should not be used in programs intended
       to be portable.  It is present since Linux 1.1.44  and  in  libc  since
       libc 4.7.6.

BUGS
       No  error  messages of any kind are returned to the caller. At the very
       least, EPERM should be returned when the call fails.

NOTES
       Note  that at the time this system call was introduced, a process could
       send a signal to a process with the same effective user ID.  Today sig-
       nal permission handling is slightly different.
