----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NAME

   sigreturn - return from signal handler and cleanup stack frame

SYNOPSIS

   int sigreturn(unsigned long __unused);

DESCRIPTION

   When the Linux kernel creates the stack frame for a signal handler, a
   call to sigreturn is inserted into the stack frame so that the the
   signal handler will call sigreturn upon return. This inserted call to
   sigreturn cleans up the stack so that the process can restart from
   where it was interrupted by the signal.

RETURN VALUE

   sigreturn never returns.

WARNING

   The sigreturn call is used by the kernel to implement signal handlers.
   It should never be called directly. Better yet, the specific use of
   the __unused argument varies depending on the architecture.

CONFORMING TO

   sigreturn is specific to Linux and should not be used in programs
   intended to be portable.
