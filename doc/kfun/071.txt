 71 setregid       - set real and / or effective group ID

  mov  eax,71

  mov  ecx,egid  ;effective group id or -1
  int  80h

      setregid sets real and effective group ID's of
      the current process,

       Unprivileged users may only set the real group ID to the real group ID or
       the  effective  group  ID, and may only set the effective group ID to the
       real group ID, the effective group ID or the saved group ID.

       Supplying a value of -1 for either the real or effective group ID forces
       the system to leave that ID unchanged.

       If  the  real group ID is set or the effective group ID is set to a value
       not equal to the previous real group ID, the saved group ID will  be  set
       to the new effective group ID.


RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EPERM  The current process is not the super-user and changes other than
              (i)  swapping  the  effective user (group) ID with the real user
              (group) ID, or (ii) setting one to the value  of  the  other  or
              (iii)  setting the effective user (group) ID to the value of the
              saved user (group) ID was specified.
