  // vm86 - vm86 call for DOS emu.

       The  system  call  vm86 was introduced in Linux 0.97p2. In Linux 2.1.15
       and 2.0.28 it was renamed to vm86old, and a new  vm86  was  introduced.
       The  definition of `struct vm86_struct' was changed in 1.1.8 and 1.1.9.

       These calls cause the process to enter VM86 mode (virtual-8086 in Intel
       literature), and are used by dosemu.

       VM86 mode is an emulation of real mode within a protected mode task.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, zero is returned. On error a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EPERM  Saved kernel stack exists. (This is a kernel sanity  check;  the
              saved stack should only exist within vm86 mode itself.)

       EFAULT This  return  value  is specific to i386 and indicates a problem
              with getting userspace data.

       ENOSYS This return value indicates the call is not implemented  on  the
              present architecture.

CONFORMING TO
       This  call  is specific to Linux on Intel processors, and should not be
       used in programs intended to be portable.
