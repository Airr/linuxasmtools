which

       The  scheduling  priority  of  the  process, process group, or user, as
       indicated by which and who is obtained with the  getpriority  call  and
       set   with  the  setpriority  call.   Which  is  one  of  PRIO_PROCESS,
       PRIO_PGRP, or PRIO_USER, and who is interpreted relative  to  which  (a
       process  identifier  for  PRIO_PROCESS,  process  group  identifier for
       PRIO_PGRP, and a user ID for PRIO_USER).

who
---
       Who is set to real user id or group id.  A zero value for who  denotes
       (respectively)  the  calling  process, the process group of the calling
       process, or the real user ID of the calling process.


       The getpriority call returns the  highest  priority  (lowest  numerical
       value) enjoyed by any of the specified processes.  The setpriority call
       sets the priorities of all of the specified processes to the  specified
       value.  Only the super-user may lower priorities.

RETURN VALUE
       Since getpriority can legitimately return the value -1, error handling
       must not assume it is an error.

ERRORS
       ESRCH  No process was located using the which and who values specified.

       EINVAL Which was not one of PRIO_PROCESS, PRIO_PGRP, or PRIO_USER.

       In addition to the errors indicated above, setpriority may fail if:

       EPERM  A  process  was  located, but neither the effective nor the real
              user ID of the caller matches its effective user ID.

       EACCES A non super-user attempted to lower a process priority.
