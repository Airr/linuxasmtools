       The  getcwd() function copies an absolute pathname of the current work-
       ing directory to the array pointed to by buf, which is of length  size.

       If  the  current  absolute path name would require a buffer longer than
       size elements, the error ERANGE is returned in eax; an  appli-
       cation  should  check  for  this error, and allocate a larger buffer if
       necessary.

       If buf is NULL, the behaviour of getcwd() is undefined.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns negative error in eax or size of path string.  If eax
       positive then "buf" has path string.

ERRORS
       EACCES Permission  to  read  or search a component of the file name was
              denied.

       EFAULT buf points to a bad address.

       EINVAL The size argument is zero and buf is not a null pointer.

       ENOENT The current working directory has been unlinked.

       ERANGE The size argument is less than the length of the working  direc-
              tory name.  You need to allocate a bigger array and try again.

       These functions are often used to save  the  location  of  the  current
       working directory for the purpose of returning to it later. Opening the
       current directory (".") and calling fchdir(2) to return  is  usually  a
       faster  and  more  reliable  alternative  when  sufficiently  many file
       descriptors are available, especially on platforms other than Linux.
