 41 dup            - duplicate a file descriptor
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov  eax,041       ;dup (dupfd)
  mov   ebx,oldfd    ;fd to dup
  int   80h

       dup creates a copy of the file descriptor oldfd.
       dup uses the lowest-numbered unused descriptor for the new  descriptor.

       After successful return of dup , the old and new descriptors may
       be used interchangeably. They share locks, file position  pointers  and
       flags;  for example, if the file position is modified by using lseek on
       one of the descriptors, the position is also changed for the other.

       The two descriptors do not share the close-on-exec flag, however.

RETURN VALUE
       dup returns the new descriptor, or negative error

ERRORS
       EBADF  oldfd  isn't  an  open  file  descriptor, or newfd is out of the
              allowed range for file descriptors.

       EMFILE The process already has the maximum number of  file  descriptors
              open and tried to open a new one.

       EINTR  The dup2 call was interrupted by a signal.

       EBUSY  (Linux  only)  This may be returned by dup2 during a race condi-
              tion with open() and dup().
