   Returns information about the file system types currently present in
   the kernel.

 ebx     option  1: fstype index by fs-name
                 2: fs-name @arg2 by fstype-index
                 3: no. of known file system types

 ecx     if ebx=1 then ecx= ptr to string;
         if ebx=2 then ecx= fstype index

 edx     if ebx=2 then edx= ptr to string buffer

   ebx option 1 translates the file-system identifier string pointed
   to by ecx into a file-system type index, and edx is ignored.
   The numbering of the file-system type indexes begins with zero.

   ebx option 2 Translates the file-system type index ecx into a
   null-terminated file-system identifier string. This string will
   be written to the buffer pointed to by edx. Make sure that buffer
   has enough space to accept the string.

   ebx option 3 Returns the total number of file system types currently
   present in the kernel, and ecx and edx are ignored.

   Return values

   If the system call succeeds the return value is the file-system index
   for option 1, zero for option 2, and the number of currently
   configured file systems for option 3.
   If the system call fails the return value is one of the following
   errno values:

   -EFAULT Either ecx or edx is outside your accessible address space.
   -EINVAL ecx (option 1) is not a valid file-system type identifier; ecx
    (option 2) is out-of-bounds; ebx is invalid.
