DESCRIPTION

   pread() reads up to count bytes from file descriptor fd at offset
   offset (from the start of the file) into the buffer starting at buf.
   The file offset is not changed.

   The file referenced by fd must be capable of seeking.

RETURN VALUE

   On success, the number of bytes read is returned (zero
   indicates that nothing was read (end of file).
   On error a negative error code is returned.

ERRORS

   pread can fail and set errno to any error specified for read or
   lseek.

HISTORY

   The pread and pwrite system calls were added to Linux in version
   2.1.60; the entries in the i386 system call table were added in
   2.1.69. The libc support (including emulation on older kernels without
   the system calls) was added in glibc 2.1.
