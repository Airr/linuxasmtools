       truncate  causes the regular file named by
       path to be truncated to a size of precisely length
       bytes.

       If  the  file  previously  was larger than this size, the extra data is
       lost.  If the file previously was shorter,  it  is  extended,  and  the
       extended part reads as zero bytes.

       The file pointer is not changed.

       If  the  size changed, then the ctime and mtime fields for the file are
       updated, and suid and sgid mode bits may be cleared.

       the file must be writable.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error, a negative code is returned

ERRORS

       EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of the path  prefix,
              or the named file is not writable by the user.

       EFAULT Path points outside the process's allocated address space.

       EFBIG  The argument length is larger than the maximum file size. (XSI)

       EINTR  A signal was caught during execution.

       EINVAL The  argument length is negative or larger than the maximum file
              size.

       EIO    An I/O error occurred updating the inode.

       EISDIR The named file is a directory.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links  were  encountered  in  translating  the
              pathname.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              A  component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an entire
              path name exceeded 1023 characters.

       ENOENT The named file does not exist.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       EROFS  The named file resides on a read-only file system.

       ETXTBSY
              The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file  that  is  being
              executed.

       For  ftruncate the same errors apply, but instead of things that can be
       wrong with path, we now have things that can be wrong with fd:

       EBADF  The fd is not a valid descriptor.

       EBADF or EINVAL
              The fd is not open for writing.

       EINVAL The fd does not reference a regular file.
