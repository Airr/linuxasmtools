 81 setgroups      - set list of supplementary group IDs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov eax,081

  mov ecx,list  ;ptr to buffer with group info
  int 80h

      Sets the supplementary group IDs  for  the  process.   Only  the
      super-user may use this function.

RETURN VALUE
      On success, zero is returned.  On error, a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EFAULT list has an invalid address.

       EPERM  For setgroups, the user is not the super-user.

       EINVAL For  setgroups,  size  is  greater  than  NGROUPS  (32 for Linux
              2.0.32).  For getgroups, size is less than the number of supple-
              mentary group IDs, but is not zero.

NOTES
       A  process  can have up to at least NGROUPS_MAX supplementary group IDs
       in addition to the effective group ID. The set of  supplementary  group
       IDs  is inherited from the parent process and may be changed using set-
       groups.  The maximum number of supplementary group  IDs  can  be  found
       using sysconf(3):
           long ngroups_max;
           ngroups_max = sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX);
       The  maximal  return  value of getgroups cannot be larger than one more
       than the value obtained this way.
