   techniques for access to the corresponding file.

flag

   POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL - Expect sequential page references.
   POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED   - Expect access in the near future.
   POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED   - Don't access in the near future.
   POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE    - Data will be accessed once.

RETURN VALUE
   If the system call succeeds the return value is 0 else,

   -EBADF An invalid file descriptor was specified.
   -EINVAL An invalid f_mapping of file, edx value is samller than 0, or
           esi value unknown.

   Available since kernel version 2.6.0
