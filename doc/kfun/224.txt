224 gettid              - get thread ID
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  mov eax,224
  int 80h

  This function returns the current thread ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>

       pid_t gettid(void);

DESCRIPTION
       gettid returns the thread ID of the current process.  This is equal
       to the process ID (as returned by getpid),  unless  the  process  is
       part  of a thread group (created by specifying the CLONE_THREAD flag to
       the clone system call).  All processes in the same thread group have
       the same PID, but each one has a unique TID.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, returns the thread ID of the current process.

ERRORS
       This call is always successful.

CONFORMING TO
       gettid is Linux specific and should not be used in programs that are
       intended to be portable.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call

       clone, fork, getpid
