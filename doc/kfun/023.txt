       setuid  sets  the  effective  user  ID  of the current process.  If the
       effective userid of the caller is root, the real and  saved  user  ID's
       are also set.

       Under  Linux,  setuid  is  implemented  like the POSIX version with the
       _POSIX_SAVED_IDS feature.  This allows a setuid (other than root)  pro-
       gram  to  drop  all of its user privileges, do some un-privileged work,
       and then re-engage the original effective user ID in a secure manner.

       If the user is root or the program is setuid root, special care must be
       taken.  The  setuid function checks the effective uid of the caller and
       if it is the superuser, all process related user ID's are set  to  uid.
       After  this  has  occurred,  it is impossible for the program to regain
       root privileges.

       Thus, a setuid-root program wishing to  temporarily  drop  root  privi-
       leges,  assume  the  identity  of a non-root user, and then regain root
       privileges afterwards cannot use setuid.  You can accomplish this  with
       the (non-POSIX, BSD) call seteuid.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, zero is returned. else a negative error

ERRORS
       EPERM  The user is not the super-user, and uid does not match the  real
              or saved user ID of the calling process.

       EAGAIN The  uid  does  not match the current uid and uid brings process
              over it's NPROC rlimit.

LINUX-SPECIFIC REMARKS
       Linux has the concept of filesystem user  ID,  normally  equal  to  the
       effective user ID.  The setuid call also sets the filesystem user ID of
       the current process.  See setfsuid(2).

       If uid is different from the old effective uid,  the  process  will  be
       able to leave a core dumps.
