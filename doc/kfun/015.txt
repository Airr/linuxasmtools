 15 chmod          - change permissions of a file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov   eax,015         ;chmod
  mov   ebx,filename    ;ptr to asciiz path
  mov   ecx,mode
  int   80h

  The  mode of the file given by path (filename)  is changed.
  Modes are specified by or'ing the following octal numbers:
              S_ISUID   04000q set user ID on execution
              S_ISGID   02000q set group ID on execution
              S_ISVTX   01000q sticky bit
              S_IRUSR (S_IREAD) 00400q read by owner
              S_IWUSR (S_IWRITE) 00200q write by owner
              S_IXUSR (S_IEXEC) 00100q execute/search by owner
              S_IRGRP   00040q read by group
              S_IWGRP   00020q write by group
              S_IXGRP   00010q execute/search by group
              S_IROTH   00004q read by others
              S_IWOTH   00002q write by others
              S_IXOTH   00001q execute/search by others


       The effective UID of the process must be zero or must match  the  owner
       of the file.

       If  the  effective  UID of the process is not zero and the group of the
       file does not match the effective group ID of the process or one of its
       supplementary  group  IDs, the S_ISGID bit will be turned off, but this
       will not cause an error to be returned.

       Depending on the file system, set user ID and set  group  ID  execution
       bits  may  be  turned  off if a file is written.  On some file systems,
       only the super-user can set the sticky bit, which may  have  a  special
       meaning.  For the sticky bit, and for set user ID and set group ID bits
       on directories, see stat(2).

       On NFS file  systems,  restricting  the  permissions  will  immediately
       influence already open files, because the access control is done on the
       server, but open files are maintained by the client.  Widening the per-
       missions  may  be  delayed  for  other  clients if attribute caching is
       enabled on them.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       Depending  on  the file system, other errors can be returned.  The more
       general errors for chmod are listed below:


       EPERM  The effective UID does not match the owner of the file,  and  is
              not zero.

       EROFS  The named file resides on a read-only file system.

       EFAULT path points outside your accessible address space.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              path is too long.

       ENOENT The file does not exist.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving path.

       EIO    An I/O error occurred.

       The general errors for fchmod are listed below:

       EBADF  The file descriptor fildes is not valid.

       EROFS  See above.

       EPERM  See above.

       EIO    See above.
