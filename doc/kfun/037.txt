 37 kill            - send signal to a process
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov  eax,037
  mov  ebx,pid	;process id to recieve signal
  mov  ecx,sig  ;signal number to send
  int  80h

       The  kill  system  call  can  be used to send any signal to any process
       group or process.

       If pid is positive, then signal sig is sent to pid.

       If pid equals 0, then sig is sent to every process in the process group
       of the current process.

       If  pid equals -1, then sig is sent to every process except for process
       1 (init), but see below.

       If pid is less than -1, then sig  is  sent  to  every  process  in  the
       process group -pid.

       If  sig  is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still per-
       formed.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned, else a negative error code

ERRORS
       EINVAL An invalid signal was specified.

       ESRCH  The  pid or process group does not exist.  Note that an existing
              process might be a zombie, a  process  which  already  committed
              termination, but has not yet been wait()ed for.

       EPERM  The  process  does not have permission to send the signal to any
              of the receiving processes.  For a process to have permission to
              send  a  signal  to  process pid it must either have root privi-
              leges, or the real or effective user ID of the  sending  process
              must  equal  the  real  or  saved  set-user-ID  of the receiving
              process.  In the case of SIGCONT it suffices  when  the  sending
              and receiving processes belong to the same session.

NOTES
       It is impossible to send a signal to task number one, the init process,
       for which it has not installed a  signal  handler.   This  is  done  to
       assure the system is not brought down accidentally.

       POSIX  1003.1-2001 requires that kill(-1,sig) send sig to all processes
       that the current process may send signals to, except possibly for  some
       implementation-defined  system  processes.   Linux  allows a process to
       signal itself
