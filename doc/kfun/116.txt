system 116 sysinfo                 - returns information on overall system statistics

       Since Linux  2.3.23  (i386),  2.3.48 (all architectures) the structure for
       info is:


              struct sysinfo
                   uptime    resd 1 ; Seconds since boot */
                   loads     resd 3 ; 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages */
                   totalram  resd 1 ; Total usable main memory size */
                   freeram   resd 1 ; Available memory size */
                   sharedram resd 1 ; Amount of shared memory */
                   bufferram resd 1 ; Memory used by buffers */
                   totalswap resd 1 ; Total swap space size */
                   freeswap  resd 1 ; swap space still available */
                   procs     resw 1 ; Number of current processes */
                   pad       resw 1 ;
                   totalhigh resd 1 ; Total high memory size */
                   freehigh  resd 1 ; Available high memory size */
                   mem_unit  resd 1 ; Memory unit size in bytes */
                   f         resb 8 ; Padding for libc5 */
              endstruc

       sysinfo  provides  a  simple  way of getting overall system statistics.
       This is more portable than reading /dev/kmem.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EFAULT pointer to struct sysinfo is invalid

CONFORMING TO
       This function is Linux-specific, and should not  be  used  in  programs
       intended to be portable.

       The  Linux kernel has a sysinfo system call since 0.98.pl6.  Linux libc
       contains a sysinfo() routine since 5.3.5, and glibc has one since 1.90.
