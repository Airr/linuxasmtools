225 readahead           - Read pages and cache pages         
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  mov eax,225
  mov ebx,fd    ;open file descriptor
  mov ecx,seek  ;offset into file
  mov edx,count ;read count         
  int 80h

 This adds the request to the page cache if it isn't already there,
 else it reads the data.  

  Reading data ahead often finds errors on CD/DVD media
  and this will result in error returns (eax = negative code)
  Normally the size of a sucessful read is returned by
  readahead.

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE
       #include <fcntl.h>

       ssize_t readahead(int fd, off64_t *offset, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION
       readahead() populates the page cache with data from a file so that sub‐
       sequent reads from that file will not block on disk I/O.  The fd  argu‐
       ment  is  a  file  descriptor identifying the file which is to be read.
       The offset argument specifies the starting point from which data is  to
       be  read  and  count  specifies the number of bytes to be read.  I/O is
       performed in whole pages, so that offset is effectively rounded down to
       a page boundary and bytes are read up to the next page boundary greater
       than or equal to (offset+count).  readahead() does not read beyond  the
       end  of the file.  readahead() blocks until the specified data has been
       read.  The current file offset of the open file referred to  by  fd  is
       left unchanged.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, readahead returns 0; on failure a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for reading.

       EINVAL fd does not refer to a file type to  which  readahead()  can  be
              applied.

VERSIONS
       The readahead system call appeared in Linux 2.4.13; glibc support has
       been provided since version 2.3.

CONFORMING TO
       The readahead system call is Linux specific, and its  use  should  be
       avoided in portable applications.
