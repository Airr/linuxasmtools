       The reboot call reboots the system, or enables/disables the reboot key-
       stroke (abbreviated CAD, since the default is Ctrl-Alt-Delete;  it  can
       be changed using loadkeys).

       	LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC1	0xfee1dead
       	LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2	672274793
       	LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2A	85072278
       	LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2B	369367448
       	LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2C	537993216

       This system call will fail (with EINVAL) unless magic equals
       LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC1 (that is, 0xfee1dead) and magic2 equals
       LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2  (that  is, 672274793).

       However, since 2.1.17 LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2A  (that  is,  85072278) and
       since 2.1.97 LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2B (that is, 369367448) and since 2.5.71
       LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2C (that is, 537993216) are permitted  as  value for
       magic2. (The  hexadecimal values of these constants are meaningful.)

     The flag argument can have the following values:

      * RESTART     Restart system using default command and mode.
      * HALT        Stop OS and give system control to ROM monitor, if any.
      * CAD_ON      Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence causes RESTART command.
      * CAD_OFF     Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence sends SIGINT to init task.
      * POWER_OFF   Stop OS and remove all power from system, if possible.
      * RESTART2    Restart system using given command string.
      * SW_SUSPEND  Suspend system using software suspend if compiled in.
      * KEXEC       Restart system using a previously loaded Linux kernel

       LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART
              (RB_AUTOBOOT, 0x1234567).  The message `Restarting  system.'  is
              printed, and a default restart is performed immediately.  If not
              preceded by a sync(2), data will be lost.

       LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_HALT
              (RB_HALT_SYSTEM, 0xcdef0123; since 1.1.76).  The message `System
              halted.' is printed, and the system is halted.  Control is given
              to the ROM monitor, if there is  one.   If  not  preceded  by  a
              sync(2), data will be lost.

       LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_POWER_OFF
              (0x4321fedc;  since  2.1.30).   The  message  `Power  down.'  is
              printed, the system is stopped, and all power  is  removed  from
              the  system,  if  possible.   If not preceded by a sync, data
              will be lost.

       LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART2
              (0xa1b2c3d4; since 2.1.30).  The message `Restarting system with
              command  '%s''  is  printed,  and  a  restart (using the command
              string given in arg) is performed immediately.  If not  preceded
              by a sync, data will be lost.

       LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_CAD_ON
              (RB_ENABLE_CAD,  0x89abcdef).   CAD is enabled.  This means that
              the CAD keystroke will immediately cause the  action  associated
              to LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART.

       LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_CAD_OFF
              (RB_DISABLE_CAD,  0).  CAD is disabled.  This means that the CAD
              keystroke will cause a SIGINT signal to be sent to init (process
              1),  whereupon  this  process  may  decide  upon a proper action
              (maybe: kill all processes, sync, reboot).

       Only the super-user may use this function.

       The precise effect of the above actions depends  on  the  architecture.
       For the i386 architecture, the additional argument does not do anything
       at present (2.1.122), but the type of reboot can be determined by  ker-
       nel  command  line  arguments (`reboot=...') to be either warm or cold,
       and either hard or through the BIOS.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EINVAL Bad magic numbers or flag.

       EPERM  A non-root user attempts to call reboot.

       EFAULT Problem      with      getting      userspace     data     under
              LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART2.

CONFORMING TO
       reboot is Linux specific, and should not be used in  programs  intended
       to be portable.
