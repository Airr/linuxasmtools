119 sigreturn       - return from signal handler and cleanup stack frame
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov  eax,119
  int  80h

  When the Linux kernel creates the stack frame for a signal handler, a
  call to sigreturn is inserted into the stack frame so that the the
  signal handler will call sigreturn upon return. This inserted call to
  sigreturn cleans up the stack so that the process can restart from where
  it was interrupted by the signal.

 return value --
  sigreturn never returns.

  WARNING
  The sigreturn call is used by the kernel to implement signal handlers.
  It should never be called directly. Better yet, the specific use of the
  __unused argument varies depending on the architecture.
