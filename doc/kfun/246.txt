  mov  ebx,ctxp  ;pointer to context
  int  80h


SYNOPSIS

       int io_destroy(aio_context_t ctx);


DESCRIPTION
       io_destroy()  removes the asynchronous I/O context from the list of I/O
       contexts and then destroys it.  io_destroy() can also cancel  any  out‚Äê
       standing asynchronous I/O actions on ctx and block on completion.

RETURN VALUE
       io_destroy()  returns  0  on success; on failure, it returns one of the
       errors listed under ERRORS.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The AIO context specified by ctx is invalid.

       EFAULT The context pointed to is invalid.

       ENOSYS io_destroy() is not implemented on this architecture.

VERSIONS
       The asynchronous I/O system calls first appeared in Linux  2.5,  August
       2002.

CONFORMING TO
       io_destroy()  is Linux specific and should not be used in programs that
       are intended to be portable.
