 61 chroot         - change root directory
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov   eax,061
  mov   ebx,path
  int   80h

       chroot  changes  the  root  directory  to that specified in path.  This
       directory will be used for path  names  beginning  with  /   The  root
       directory is inherited by all children of the current process.

       Only the super-user may change the root directory.

       Note  that  this call does not change the current working directory, so
       that "." can be outside the tree rooted at  "/".   In  particular,  the
       super-user  can escape from a `chroot jail' by doing `mkdir foo; chroot
       foo; cd ..'.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error negative code is returned.
