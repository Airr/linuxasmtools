DESCRIPTION
       io_setup()  creates an asynchronous I/O context capable of receiving at
       least nr_events.  ctxp must not point to existing aio context.  It also
       must be initialized to 0 prior to the call.  On successful
       creation of the AIO context appears as:

       ecx -> ctxp -> context handle (same as aio_ring_base)
                      dd id (address of aio_ring_base)
                      dd nr (number of contexts possible)
                      dd head
                      dd tail
                      dd magic (a10a10a1)
                      dd compat
                      dd incompat
                      dd header_len
                      dq event1_data (kernel sets to handler)
                      dq event1_obj  (iocb ptr for event1)
                      dq event1_result (eax return code)
                      dq event1_result (suplemental result)

      Once created an AIO context can be reused for reads,writes, etc.
       
RETURN VALUE
       io_setup()  returns  0  on  success;  on failure, it returns one of the
       errors listed under ERRORS.

ERRORS
       EINVAL ctxp is not initialized,  or  the  specified  nr_events  exceeds
              internal limits. nr_events should be greater than 0.

       EFAULT An invalid pointer is passed for ctxp.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel resources are available.

       EAGAIN The  specified  nr_events  exceeds the userâ€™s limit of available
              events.

       ENOSYS io_setup() is not implemented on this architecture.

VERSIONS
       The asynchronous I/O system calls first appeared in Linux  2.5,  August
       2002.

CONFORMING TO
       io_setup()  is  Linux  specific and should not be used in programs that
       are intended to be portable.
