   mov ecx,dirp ;ptr to structure   

       This is not the function you are interested in.  it is superseeded by
       getdents.

       readdir reads one dirent structure from the directory pointed at by  fd
       into  the  memory  area  pointed  to  by  dirp.  The parameter count is
       ignored; at most one dirent structure is read.

       The dirent structure is declared as follows:

              struct dirent
              {
                  long d_ino;                 /* inode number */
                  off_t d_off;                /* offset to this dirent */
                  unsigned short d_reclen;    /* length of this d_name */
                  char d_name [NAME_MAX+1];   /* file name (null-terminated) */
              }

       d_ino is an inode number.  d_off is the distance from the start of  the
       directory to this dirent.  d_reclen is the size of d_name, not counting
       the null terminator.  d_name is a null-terminated file name.


RETURN VALUE
       On success, 1 is returned.  On end of directory,  0  is  returned.   On
       error, a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EBADF  Invalid file descriptor fd.

       EFAULT Argument points outside the calling process's address space.

       EINVAL Result buffer is too small.

       ENOENT No such directory.

       ENOTDIR
              File descriptor does not refer to a directory.

CONFORMING TO
       This system call is Linux specific.
