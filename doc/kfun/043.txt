 43 times          - get process times

  mov  eax,043
  mov  ebx,buf  ;!!! (see note)
  int  80h

  note: It appears that setting ebx to buffer is incorrect.  EBX appears to
        be ignored.  The return value is in EAX and is time since boot in ticks.
        The following description is widely reported but wrong.


       The times() function stores the current process times in the struct tms
       that buf points to.  The struct tms is as defined in <sys/times.h>:

       struct tms
              resd 1 ;user time
              resd 1 ;system time
              resd 1 ;user (utime) time of children
              resd 1 ;system (stime) time of children
       endstruc

       The "user" field contains the CPU time spent executing instructions
       of  the  calling  process.   The  "system" field contains the CPU time
       spent in the system while executing tasks on behalf of the calling
       process.   The  utime  field contains the sum of the children user time.
       The stime field contains the sum of all children system times.

       Times for terminated children (and their descendants) is  added  in  at
       the  moment wait(2) or waitpid(2) returns their process ID. In particu-
       lar, times of grandchildren that the children  did  not  wait  for  are
       never seen.

       All times reported are in clock ticks.

RETURN VALUE
       The  function times returns the number of clock ticks that have elapsed
       since an arbitrary point in the past.  For  Linux  this  point  is  the
       moment  the system was booted.  This return value may overflow the pos-
       sible range of type clock_t.  On error, a negative code is returned

NOTES
       The number of clock ticks per second can be obtained using
              sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK);
       In  POSIX-1996 the symbol CLK_TCK (defined in <time.h>) is mentioned as
       obsolescent. It is obsolete now.

       On Linux, if the disposition of SIGCHLD is  set  to  SIG_IGN  then  the
       times   of  terminated  children  are  automatically  included  in  the
       "user" and "system" fields, although POSIX 1003.1-2001 says  that
       this should only happen if the calling process wait()s on its children.

       Note that clock(3) returns values of type clock_t that are not measured
       in clock ticks but in CLOCKS_PER_SEC.
