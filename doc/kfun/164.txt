164 setresuid      - set real user ID

       setresuid  sets  the real user ID, the effective user ID, and the saved
       (effective) user ID of the current process.

       Unprivileged user processes (i.e., processes with each of real,  effec-
       tive  and  saved  user  ID  nonzero) may change the real, effective and
       saved user ID, each to one of: the current uid, the  current  effective
       uid or the current saved uid.

       The  super-user  may set real, effective and saved user ID to arbitrary
       values.

       If one of the parameters equals -1,  the  corresponding  value  is  not
       changed.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error a negative code is returned

ERRORS
       EPERM  The current  process  was  not  privileged  (did  not  have  the
              CAP_SETUID  capability)  and  tried  to  change the IDs is a not
              allowed way.

       EAGAIN uid does not match the current uid and  this  call  would  bring
              that userID over its NPROC rlimit.
