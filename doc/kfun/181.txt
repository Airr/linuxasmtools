DESCRIPTION

   pwrite() writes up to count bytes from the buffer starting at buf to
   the file descriptor fd at offset offset. The file offset is not
   changed.

   The file referenced by fd must be capable of seeking.

RETURN VALUE

   On success, the number of bytes read or written is returned (zero
   indicates that nothing was written,  or a negative code if errors
   occur.

ERRORS

   pwrite can fail and set errno to any error specified for
   write or lseek.

HISTORY

   The pread and pwrite system calls were added to Linux in version
   2.1.60; the entries in the i386 system call table were added in
   2.1.69. The libc support (including emulation on older kernels without
   the system calls) was added in glibc 2.1.
