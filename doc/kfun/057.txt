       setpgid  sets  the  process group ID of the process specified by pid to
       pgid.  If pid is zero, the process ID of the current process  is  used.
       If  pgid  is  zero,  the  process ID of the process specified by pid is
       used.  If setpgid is used to move a process from one process  group  to
       another  (as  is  done  by  some  shells when creating pipelines), both
       process groups must be part of the same session.   In  this  case,  the
       pgid  specifies  an existing process group to be joined and the session
       ID of that group must match the session ID of the joining process.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, setpgid return zero.  On error a negative code

ERRORS
       EINVAL pgid is less than 0 (setpgid, setpgrp).

       EACCES An attempt was made to change the process group ID of one of the
              children  of  the calling process and the child had already per-
              formed an execve (setpgid, setpgrp).

       EPERM  An attempt was made to move a process into a process group in  a
              different  session,  or to change the process group ID of one of
              the children of the calling process and the child was in a  dif-
              ferent  session,  or to change the process group ID of a session
              leader (setpgid, setpgrp).

       ESRCH  pid is not the current process and not a child of the current
              process.
