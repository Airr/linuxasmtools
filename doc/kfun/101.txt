system 101 ioperm                  - set port input/output permissions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mov  eax,101

  mov  ecx,num      ;number of ports to set
  mov  edx,turn_on  ;value to set

       Ioperm  sets  the  port  access permission bits for the process for num
       bytes starting from port address from to the value turn_on.  The use of
       ioperm requires root privileges.

       Only  the  first  0x3ff I/O ports can be specified in this manner.  For
       more ports, the iopl function must be used.  Permissions are not inher-
       ited  on  fork,  but  on  exec they are. This is useful for giving port
       access permissions to non-privileged tasks.

       This call is mostly for the i386 architecture.  On many other architec-
       tures it does not exist or will always return an error.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error, a negative code  is returned

ERRORS
       EINVAL Invalid values for from or num.

       EPERM  Caller does not have the CAP_SYS_RAWIO privileges.

       EIO    (on ppc) This call is not supported.

CONFORMING TO
       ioperm is Linux specific and should not be used in programs intended to
       be portable.
