system 130 get_kernel_syms         - retrieve exported kernel and module symbols 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Note:  This function does not appear to be implemented.  Returned error.

  mov  eax,130
  mov  ebx,table
  int  80h

       If  table is NULL, get_kernel_syms returns the number of symbols avail-
       able for query.  Otherwise it fills in a table of structures:

              struct kernel_sym
                .value  resd 1 ;
                .name   resb 60 ;
              endstruc

       The symbols are interspersed with magic symbols of  the  form  #module-
       name with the kernel having an empty name.  The value associated with a
       symbol of this form is the address at which the module is loaded.

       The symbols exported from each module follow their magic module tag and
       the modules are returned in the reverse order they were loaded.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns the number of symbols returned.  There is no possible error
       return.

SEE ALSO
       create_module, init_module, delete_module, query_module.

BUGS
       There is no way to indicate the size of the buffer allocated for table.
       If  symbols have been added to the kernel since the program queried for
       the symbol table size, memory will be corrupted.

       The length of exported symbol names is limited to 59.

       Because of these limitations, this system call is deprecated  in  favor
       of query_module.
