SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <attr/xattr.h>

       int fsetxattr(int filedes, const char *name,
                     const void *value, size_t size, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes (files,
       directories, symbolic links, etc).  They are extensions to  the  normal
       attributes  which  are  associated with all inodes in the system (i.e.,
       the stat(2) data).  A complete overview of extended attributes concepts
       can be found in attr(5).

       fsetxattr()  is identical to setxattr(), only the extended attribute is
       set on the open file pointed to by filedes (as returned by open(2))  in
       place of path.

       An  extended  attribute  name  is a simple null-terminated string.  The
       name includes a namespace prefix; there may be several, disjoint names‐
       paces  associated  with  an individual inode.  The value of an extended
       attribute is a chunk of arbitrary textual or binary data  of  specified
       length.

       The  flags  parameter can be used to refine the semantics of the opera‐
       tion.  XATTR_CREATE specifies a pure create, which fails if  the  named
       attribute exists already.  XATTR_REPLACE specifies a pure replace oper‐
       ation, which fails if the named attribute does not already  exist.   By
       default  (no flags), the extended attribute will be created if need be,
       or will simply replace the value if the attribute exists.

flags
-----
        XATTR_CREATE	0x1	/* set value, fail if attr already exists */
        XATTR_REPLACE	0x2	/* set value, fail if attr does not exist */

	 We can never set or remove an extended attribute on a read-only
	 filesystem  or on an immutable / append-only inode.


RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On failure a negative code is returned

       If  XATTR_CREATE  is specified, and the attribute exists already, errno
       is set to EEXIST.  If XATTR_REPLACE is  specified,  and  the  attribute
       does not exist, errno is set to ENOATTR.

       If  there  is  insufficient  space  remaining  to  store  the  extended
       attribute, errno is set to either ENOSPC, or EDQUOT if  quota  enforce‐
       ment was the cause.

       If extended attributes are not supported by the filesystem, or are dis‐
       abled, errno is set to ENOTSUP.

       The errors documented for the stat(2) system call are  also  applicable
       here.

VERSIONS
       These system calls have been available on Linux since kernel 2.4; glibc
       support is provided since version 2.3.

CONFORMING TO
       These system calls are Linux specific.
