NAME

  sort - sort text file

SYNOPSIS

  sort <infile> <ourfile>

DESCRIPTION

 sorts infile and stores at outfile.  This version
 does not allocate memory, so file and index must
 fit in 300k

 The merge_sort is a text sort and assumes lines end
 with 0ah (eol).  Tabs are equivelent to spaces.

 This program will usually produce the same output
 as standard GNU sort program without any parameters.
