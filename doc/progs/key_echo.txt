NAME

 key_echo - display hex codes issued with key press

SYNOPSIS

 key_echo
 no parameters are used by key_echo

DESCRIPTION

 the unix keyboard uses several bytes to report some
 key presses. For example, the arrow keys can generate
 several different strings of bytes. A sequence of bytes
 always starts with the escape character (1bh).

 Programs need to handle all the byte sequences possible
 for a key and key_echo helps by displaying the output
 for the current terminal.

USAGE

   All keys on keyboard result in a display except
   for the "q" key which exits the program.
