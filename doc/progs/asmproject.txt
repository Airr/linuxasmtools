 asmproj - setup directory for assembler project

SYNOPSIS

  asmproj
  no parameters are used by asmproj

DESCRIPTION

  asmproj is an interactive program to check if
  tools (programs) are available to support a project
  and build a simple source file and a makefile to
  compile it.

USAGE

  all activity is controlled by menus with visible
  help. The program does not have additional
  documentation.

  asmproj assumes each project will have a separate directory
  and sets this up first. Then it selects the type of project
  by the needed tools.
