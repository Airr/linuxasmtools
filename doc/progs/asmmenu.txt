 Asmmenu - display menu for shell script


    usage: from within script (menu definition at end of script)
           execute: asmmenu $0 <-- this gives AsmMenu the
                                   script file location.

    introduction:
          AsmMenu is a very easy to use menu system for shell
          scripts. The caller only needs to identify the button
          size and then make a text map of the buttons in the
          pattern they are to be displayed. Reviewing the
          example below should explain the setup needed.
        
    operation:
    ----------
          Asmmenu extracts a menu definition from the executing
          shell script. Only one menu definition can be placed
          in the shell script and it must be at the end and built
          as described below. AsmMenu reads the shell script and
          displays the menu it finds. When a button is pushed the
          code for that button is returned to the calling shell
          script and AsmMenu exits.

          This design works because shell scripts can be told to
          exit and ignore any data that follows. We can then
          use the end of the script file to define our menu.

    inputs
    ------
          AsmMenu finds the calling shell script and
          scans to the end looking for a menu definition.
          Each menu definition begins with: buttonsize: x,y
          Next, it expects to find box titles identified
          as: header: "text goes here"
          Multiple headers are possible. The rest of a menu
          definition is a visual button layout separated by
          tabs.

          Example of a menu definition:

          #set button size to 2 rows long and 15 columns wide
          buttonsize: 2,15
          header: "this is a sample header"

          <tab> hello I am  <tab>  i'm a 
          <tab> button 1    <tab>  button

          <tab> row2      <tab> yet another
          <tab> button    <tab> button

          summary of menu options:
            buttonsize: x,y   <-- size for all buttons
            header: " "       <-- header. max number headers = 8
                                  each header starts with: header:
            color1:           <-- alternate color set #1
                                  Can be before or after header: defs
            clear:            <-- clear display after selection
                                  Place after buttonsize: and before
                                  first tab

   output
   ------

          When selected, the buttons return a code
          indicating its position. All first
          row buttons start with -1-. Second tier
          buttons start with -2-, etc. Next, the
          button column is included within the code.
          Thus, 12 indicates row 1 column 2. Thus,
          the above example returns codes showing
          button position as follows:

                11             12

                21             22

          If AsmMenu encounters an error it will
          return -1. It will also display a message.

   limitations
   -----------

          The maximum number of text rows in a single button
          is 4. The maximum number of columns in a single
          button is 200 or the screen size. The maximum
          number of buttons is 49. The maximum number or
          buttons on a line is 9. The maximum number of
          button rows is 9.

          AsmMenu only runs on the Linux console or in
          a terminal and only on X86 processors. It can
          be used within X-windows by utilizing a terminal
          program such as xterm,rxvt, or konsole.
          For most terminals the following will work:

          xterm -e script

   example shell script
   --------------------

          #Shell script to call asmmenu and capture
          #the return code

          asmmenu $0
          if [ $? = 11 ]; then
          echo "button row 1 column 1"
          else
          echo "some other button"
          fi
          exit
          #------------------------------------
          #single button menu
          buttonsize: 1,4
          header: "the menu"
          <tab> test
