 asmview - text file viewer

SYNOPSIS

    usage: asmview file
           asmview < file
           cat file | asmview
           asmview

    if no file name is provided or if a bad filename is
    provided the program displays a file selection window.

DESCRIPTION

AsmView reads a file into memory and converts all non-text
(binary) data to "." (period) characters. The data is then
displayed in a window. The data can be scrolled in any direction.
Long lines will extend beyond the right edge of the screen and
can be viewed with the right-arrow key.
