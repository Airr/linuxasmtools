NAME

  AsmTools - collection of tools for assembler development

SYNOPSIS

  asmfile <path> <path>
   where: <path> is path of work directory

DESCRIPTION

   asmtools consists of a manager (asmfile) which provides access
   to a debugger, disassembler, source generator, project planner,
   editors, library, comment extractor, assembler reference, and others.
   If you prefer, asmfile can be ignored and the individual
   tool used.

   All tools are standalone programs, but they can be used as
   package if AsmFile or AsmEdit is active.
  
   asmtools runs as a Linux terminal program. most of the programs
   will run in the console and all run in a x-terminal. the install
   is from a tar.gz file and no compile is needed. the binaries will
   run on any x86 Linux system.

INSTALL
  
   After asmtools is installed (see instructions in tar.gz file)
   start the manager by typing "asmfile" in a terminal or the
   console. Some tools will request additional install information
   when they are executed.
  
USAGE

  The "tools/proj" button can be used to begin an assembler program. This
  will create a source file and make file. The program can be
  compiled by clicking on "make" and then debugged by highlighting
  the executable and clicking "debug"

  To navigate in asmfile, use arrow keys. The help button provides
  move usage hints, and the "tools" button provides extensive
  reference material for assembler development.
