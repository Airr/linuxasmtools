This is FAQ for the AsmTools family of programs.

1. What is AsmTools?

   AsmTools is a growing collection of programs
   written in assembler to support development
   in the Linux console or x terminal environments.

   The AsmRef program provides documentation to
   each program along with other information of
   interest to assembly language programmers.
   
2. This collection of programs is confusing, is
   there an easy way to set it up?

   Answer: The best way to start is to make a
   master directory (AsmTools) and decompress the
   AsmTools tag.gz file here.  Then do a "make
   install" as root.  If you have the
   individual programs as tar.gs's then decompress
   them in this directory.  This should include:
   AsmRef, AsmFile, AsmEdit, AsmLib. Then enter each
   directory and do a "make install" as root.

   It is probably a good idea to briefly review
   operation of the AsmFile program at this point
   by typing "asmfile" and clicking on "tools" and
   then on "reference"

3. I like editor x and want to use it rather than
   AsmEdit, is this possible?

   Answer: Yes, any text style editor should
   work, although a programmers editor may be
   a better choice.  Programmers can get fanatic
   about the choice of editors and the 
   vi versus emacs debate has raged for years.
   For this reason AsmTools tries to be editor
   neutral.

4. Is there a style of development that AsmTools
   encourages?

   Answer: No.  You can choose the tools and style
   that is comfortable.

5. Which tools are best to start with?

   Answer: New assembly programmers are probably better
   off selecting the most used tools.  this includes
   the nasm or yasm assemblers.  Any editor they like
   or the built in AsmEdit.  The choice of libraries
   is more complicated.  Assembly can use many existing
   libraries but it may be easiest to start with AsmLib
   because the documentation is written for assembly.
   AsmLib is automatically set up by AsmTools and the
   AsmRef help system describes  many sample programs.

6. What about bugs?  Is AsmTools stable?

   This is a growing project and it will have bugs.
   The core programs are in constant use and are
   not expected to harbor any major problems.  The
   newer programs will have a higher probability of
   problems.  No bugs are known as of 8-31-2007
