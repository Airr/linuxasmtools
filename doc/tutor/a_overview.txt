AsmTools is a collection of programs for
assembler development on Linux X86 cpu's.

Features include:
 
 * kernel reference
 * Library for asm programs
 * x86 reference 
 * examples, tutorial, and other documentation.
 * Small size to feature ratio
 * editor with hooks for helper routines
 * works in console and xterm.
 * utilizes mouse in xterm.
 * other programs include: debugger, source generator,
   disassembler, develpment manager, and many more.

All the programs are designed to work as standalone
utilities.  They can also be coordinated by using
AsmFile and to some extent AsmEdit.  Two libraries
are provided.  A general library supporting either
the console or terminal.  Another library supporting
the x server.

Since each program is separate, they can be compiled
and installed without the others.  The only dependency
is usually AsmLib.  At run time some programs
make use of unix utilities and most of these are
already present.  If the utility is missing, the
feature doesn't funtion.

 There are not many Linux assembler programmers
 doing anything on the desktop so this is a very
 small group and all questions or discusson is
 welcome.
