AsmEdit tutorial
  Press ESC then the "w" key twice to
  begin.  From now on keys needed
  will be shown as:

     ESC w w

  The screen should now be split
  vertically with a help screen
  on the right.

  This tutorial screen can be
  scrolled up or down with the
  arrow keys.

Menu's and Mice

  Asmedit controls can work in
  three different styles: keyboard
  commands, mouse clicks, or a
  hybrid menu using upper case
  keys.  Next we will explore the
  three styles.

  The bottom line has edit status.
  Press the space bar a few times a
  watch this line.

    <space>  <space>

  The menu line now shows key hints
  and provides mouse buttons.  Now
  press ESC to go back to the status
  line, then shift-i

    ESC  shift-i

  ESC restores the status line and
  shift says to display menu mode
  after executing the "i" command.
  The "i" command enters edit mode
  for inserting data.

  Warning.. this is an active edit
  session and anything typed will
  be entered into this tutorial.

  Press the spacebar to insert a
  space at the cursor and then press
  backspace to erase this space.

    <space>  <backspace>

  The status bar now shows the following
  information:
  INS - we are in insert mode
  xxline - cursor line number
  xxcol - cursor column
  xxhex - character under cursor
  filex - file 1 or file 2
  *     - file has been modified
  xxxx  - file name
  f1 - help 

  press ESC to leave edit mode and
  restore command mode.  Notice the
  CMD indicator on status line.

    ESC

  The rest of this tutorial will
  use the default keyboard style
  of command entry.

Windows and files

  AsmEdit has three window styles and
  can work on two files at the same
  time.  The "w" key toggles window
  styles and the other "o" key toggles
  focus to the other file.

  press "w" a few times and watch window
  styles.

      w w w

  press "o" to switch to other file in
  the other window.  Then press "o" again
  to return here.

  summary - with the keys covered it is
  possible to switch windows, scroll around
  and enter the edit mode.  This is enough
  for simple editing jobs.

  next we will explore using AsmEdit
  IDE functions.

Function Keys

  The function keys work in all modes
  and can be pressed at any time.  For
  example, you can exit now by pressing
  f10.  

  Display the function key menu by
  pressing the space bar until it
  appears.

     <space>  <space>

  The function keys f1 - f9 can be
  redefined and the menu shows a
  default state.  The default state
  is to setup a simple IDE for assembler
  programs.  f3 calls a "make" file
  and f4 kicks off a debugger.  The
  defaults can be changed by editing
  control scripts or by where scripts
  are placed.  Scripts found in the
  current directory are executed before
  scripts found elsewhere.

  Most of the function keys call
  external programs and only work if
  the needed program is installed.
  The planning program comes
  with AsmEdit and should be here,
  so press f2 to see a simple project
  planner.

Summary

  The commands covered allows simple
  programs to be edited and then
  compiled.  Errors will be placed in
  a window on the right and the cursor
  restored after compile or debug.

  In other words, a simple IDE for
  assembler.

  AsmEdit is an old editor and has
  many additional commands.  The
  manual describes most of the
  features and might be a good place
  to visit next.

  The mouse can be used to move the
  cursor or traverse menu's.  click
  on the status bar to pop up the
  menu's.
