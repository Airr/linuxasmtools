NAME

 asmpub - create document from comments in source

SYNOPSIS

    asmpub <switches> -o <name> target

           where: <switches> can be:
                  -c(n) - comment character used in source files
                      example:  -c; for ";" character
                                -c# for "#" character
                     Note: no spaces can separate a -x flag and
                        associated value. thus, -r 2 is illegal.
                        Shells assume some characters have special
                        meaning and need to be told to ignore them.
                        Thus, the -c; parameter must be quoted as '-c;'
                  -f1 = format 1 (normal)
                  -f2 = format 2 (library) (see below)
                  -i  = write index file, uses -o switch to get path
                        and appends extension of .index
                  -k  = show sort key in index
                  -n  = number sections in index and title lines
                  -r(n) = recurse to  depth (n)
                      where:  default=current dir (-r1)
                              -r = recurse all directories
                              -r2 = recurse to a depth of 2
                  -s  = sort sections
           where:
                  -o(name) = base name for index and output files:
                  Note: output file is stored in current directory
                        if full path is not provided. No space
                        between -o and (name).
           where: target can be:
                  path to start search with optional file mask.
                  example:  /home/sam/project/  <- scan all files
                                                   at /project
                            /home/sam/project/*.asm <- scan all
                                                   files ending with
                                                   ".asm" at /project
                            /home/sam/mak*  <- scan all files starting
                                               with "mak"
                  note: A full target path must be provided. Examples:
                            $HOME/source/'*.asm'
                            /home/sam/source
                            /home/sam/source/'*.asm'
                        Shells treat "*" as a special character and
                        must be told to ignore it. Thus, it must be
                        quoted. Example -o*.asm  --> '-o*.asm'

DESCRIPTION

 asmpub has two modes. In mode 1 comments are extracted
 from source files if they are identified with special markers.
 The comments are moved to a output file with minimal processing.
 This mode can be modified somewhat by using command line
 parameters.

 asmpub's second mode is designed for libraries. It can separate
 each comment block, identity a title, sort by type and title,
 number each section, build a index file, and do other processing.

    operation:
    ----------
          asmpub extracts each block of text and removes the
          leading comment character. If the sort flag flag
          is enabled the blocks are sorted. Next, numbering
          is applied if enabled. The index is then written
          if enabled. Finally, the comment blocks are written
          and formatting applied.

    format of comment block in source file
    --------------------------------------

    the following assumes the comment character is ";"
    
    each comment block begins with line: ";>1" followed by optional
    sort keys:   The end of the block is specified by ";<1"
    Continuation block can start with ";>2" and end with ";<1".
    The continuation block are appended to preceding block and
    sorted with it. All comment block lines must begin at left
    edge as follows:
      summary:  ;>1  <-- begins comment block & has sort strings
                ;>2  <-- begins continuation block, sorted with parent
                ;<1  <-- ends comment or continuation block
                ;    <-- normal text within comment block

    the block beginning can have a sort key following the ";>1" string.
    the sort string can be any string and can be preceded by a space.
    example:  ;>1 key1-key2
    the sort string can appear as headers in index file if switch -k
    is used.

    f1 format - The comment blocks are written as found. (the
                leading comment character removed)  If numbering
                is enabled it will be insert at front of first line
                after the ";>" header line. The ";>" header line
                and other control lines will be removed.

    f2 format - The f2 format is for libraries and works like f1
                format with the following additions:  A blank line
                is added at start of each block. this is followed
                by a line of dashes, then the first comment line.
                Next, another line of dashes is inserted. This
                is followed by the remaining data from comment section.
