NAME

 Tracex - trace xserver packets for program

SYNOPSIS

 tracex <-r> <-t> <-h> file

 -r = optinal parameter to only show raw io

 -t = truncate all server calls. Only show
      two lines of infromation.

 -h = help message

 file = name of file to trace

 Tracex logs xserver packets to a file. The
 file name is constructed from name of program
 being traced.

DESCRIPTION

 Tracex is primarialy for assembly language programmers
 and shows xserver communication. In raw mode, a hex
 dump of each read/write block is shown. In non-raw
 mode the xserver communication packets are identified
 and labeled.

 All recieved packets are preceeded with a "-" in the
 output. The xserver protocall always sends 32 bytes
 for the start of a function. If more data is to be
 send, it uses a continuation block.

 All output to the xserver is shown without the
 preceeding "-". Output data can be collected
 in a buffer and many packets sent at the same time.
 The length of send packets is included with each packet.    

FILES

 tracex only requires one file (the executable tracex). All
 output goes to current directory. The output file will
 be called xxxxx.tra
