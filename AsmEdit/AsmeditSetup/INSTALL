These are generic install instructions for the
AsmIDE family of programs.

AsmIDE programs only run on x86 Linux systems
and do not need to be compiled first.  Install
by typing:

   make install

The AsmMgr and AsmEdit include an additional
archive called AsmFunc.  This archive will also
need to be entered and a "make install" typed.

Install will try to put all programs into the
current users home directory.  If a /bin directory
is found, it will be used for executable which
need to be reached by $PATH.

Data files and support files will be placed at
/.asmide in users home directory.

If a compile is desired, simply type make.  All
this should work without problems if the following
programs are available:

  bash - or possibly sh needed by makefile
  sed - stream editor (almost always available)
  make - GNU make needed for install,compile
  install - needed to copy programs
  nasm - (optional), needed by compile
  asmpub - (optional) used by AsmLib "make doc" option
