NAME

 copy - copy files and mirror directories

SYNOPSIS

 copy <switches> from-path to-path

  switches -a = default attributes for destination
           -c = copy if file contents different
           -d = delete "to" files if "from" not found
           -h = help display
           -n xxx  = no overwrite of files with tail xxx
           -s = copy if file sizes different
           -t = copy if destination (to) file older

  from-path = path to copy

  to_path = destination for "from-path" files


DESCRIPTION

copy has a simple interface that can perform some
complex operations. It was designed to support rsync
and mirroring of directories. It can detect copying
identicial files and avoids updating destination. This
leaves the file date unchanged.

Also, copy allows wild card (asterick) present in
both the "from" and "to" file paths. This allows
files to be renamed or selective files copied.

The default state is to copy files, but if
the -t,-s, or -c switches are used, the
state changes to non-forced.

     parameters are:

 a = set default attributes for destination

    Normally the "from-path" attributies are
    copied to the destination file. the -a switch
    forces the default system attributes instead.

 c = copy if destination file contents different

    This switch disables copying identical files
    when a copy of the file is present at
    destination (to) directory.

 d = delete destination files if no couresponding "from" file

    This switch deletes files in the destination
    directory that do not have a couresponding
    file in the "from" directory. It is useful
    in mirroring a directory.

 h = help display

 n xxx = no overwrite of files with tail of xxx

    This switch overrides all other switches.
    If any file ending with tail xxx tries
    to overwritee a file it is blocked.

 s = copy if destination file size different

    This switch disables copying files of same
    size, when a copy of the file is present at
    destination (to) directory.

 t = copy if destination file older

    This switch disables copying older files
    when a copy of the file is present at
    destination (to) directory.


 from-path = path to copy

    Specifies file or files to copy. If -d switch
    is present, this is base directory that
    controls deleting of files at to-path

    Symbolic link files are ignored. Hard link files
    are copied and treated as normal files.

    See path rules and transfer matrix

 to-path = destination for "from-path" files

    Specifies file or files to create. If -d switch
    is present, this directory can have files deleted
    if they are not present in from-path

    See path rules and transfer matrix

PATH RULES

Paths can contain the following:

    ./           current directory
    ../          previous directory
    name         any name in current directory
    name/        directory
    name/*       all files in a directory
    *name        all files ending with "name"
    name*        all files starting with "name"
    /home/xxx..  full path specification

When a name ends with / it is assumed to
a directory and is equivalent to name/*

The (asterick) only refers to files and can not be
used for directories.

When a path ends with name that matches a
existing directory, this is illegal and
produces error message.

     PATHS CONTAINING ASTERISK OR DOT CHARACTERS MUST
     BE QUOTED TO AVOID CONFUSING THE SHELL

PATH COMBINATIONS

This is simplified list of all possible path combinations.
If both paths are the same, some options will
produce an error. For example:

  copy name1 "*"
  copy "*" "*"
  copy "./*" "./*"


  from path         to path   description 
  ---------         --------  ---------------------------------------
  name1             name2     simple copy of file1 to file2
  name1             *name2    copy and append names
  name1             name2*    copy and append names
  name1             *         copy name1 to name1
  *name1            name2     copy all matching files to name2 (append)
  *name1            *name2    copy and rename
  *name1            name2*    copy and rename
  *name1            *         copy files ending with name1
  name1*            name2     copy all matching files to name2 (append)
  name1*            *name2    copy and rename
  name1*            name2*    copy and rename
  name1*            *         copy files starting with name1
  *                 name2     append all files to name2
  *                 *name2    copy and rename
  *                 name2*    copy and rename
  *                 *         copy all files, retain name

EXAMPLES

To copy all files from current directory to directory dog

  copy "*" dog/

To mirror the current directory to directory dog. Files
are copied even if they already exist in destination dir.
Any extra files are deleted from destination.

  copy -d "*" dog/

To mirror the current directory to directory dog. Only
files that are different are copied. Any extra files at
"dog" are ignored.

  copy -c "*" dog/

To append all files ending with .txt into a file called
summary.

  copy "*.txt" summary

Copy all files ending with ".txt" to a new set of files
ending with ".bak"

  copy "*.txt" "*.bak"
