NAME
 asmfind - search for files or text within files

SYNOPSIS
     asmfind "text string"
     
     the "text string" is optional and if omitted
     asmfind enters a prompting mode. The prompting
     mode is preferred usage.


DESCRIPTION
      asmfind presents a menu if no parameters are given. This is
      the expected mode of operation and offers more options than a
      simple search string.

      after setting the file mask, starting directory, case flag,
      and search sting the programs uses a fast Boyer-Moore search
      technique to find text matches. After each match a list of
      options are given as follows:
     
         ignore this match
         view file containing match
         view file with smart file viewer
         edit file (call -a- script)
         abort search

   simple search
   -------------

      When AsmFind is called with a search string it does the following:
       1. set search starting point at current directory
       2. set ignore case flag
       3. set the file mask to match all files (search all files)

      each match found will display the standard menu of options.

      if the search string has spaces or special characters then
      it needs to be quoted as follows:

           asmfind "search string"

  interactive Menu Search
  ------------------------

     the interactive menu mode is initiated by  calling asmfind
     without any parameters. It asks for the following information:

           starting path __________________
           file mask     __________________
           search string __________________
           case flag

     next, the search can be started by pressing the start button.
     the search can be aborted by any key and all matches provide
     another menu of actions.

     it is possible to search for files by leaving the search string
     blank.

VIEWING FILES

 files are viewed using AsmView as follows:

 asmview reads a file into memory and converts all non-text data
 to the "." (period) character. The data is then displayed in a
 window. The data can be scrolled in any direction. Long lines
 will extend beyond the right edge of the screen and can be viewed
 with the right-arrow key.

         keyboard controls
         ----------------

          up key - scroll up
          down key - scroll down
          pgup key - page up
          pgdn key - page down
          right,left - scroll
          esc   - exit
          f10   = exit
          f3    = exit
          enter key - begin/repeat  search
          f1 - help
          home - goto top of file
          end = goto end of file


search strings can be entered by typing a normal text character.
the search string will appear on the status line (bottom of the
display). The search string keys are:

  text key - appended to current search string
  rubout   - removes the last text character entered
  Enter    - begins search

searching always begins from the second line of currently displayed
page and all matches are positioned on the top line of the  display.
to continue searching, just keep pressing <Enter>. To start a search
from the top of file, type <home> and then either <Enter> or a new
search string followed by <Enter>

All non-control keys are assumed to be part of a search string and
will be shown at the bottom of the screen.

EDITING FILES

If a match is found and the -e- (edit) options is
selected, AsmFind will call a script by the name
of -a- (dashes are not part of name).  This script
should contain editor of choice.
An example script:

 #! /bin/sh
 # shortcut to asmedit
 asmedit $1 $2

The -a- script must be reachable by the $PATH and
normally is placed in the users /bin directory.
It needs to have the executable attribute set.
