asmlib usage hints
------------------------------------------------------------------


AsmLibx assumes some coding conventions as follows:

 1. the "CLD" flag is set.  Normally, this can be set
    at the top of a program and forgotten.  It will work
    even if we forget to do this, but good practice says
    it should be set.

 2. Most library routines do not save registers.  This elimiates
    a lot of stack pushes which are not necessary and speeds
    up code.  This deviates from most other libraries, they save
    and restore registers.      

 3. The following setup programs appear at the top of programs:
    env_stack - save ptr to the environment stack


Portability
-----------

  Some calls may need a 2.4 kernel or later.  The instructions
  do not use any newer processor features and should work on
  any 486+ processor.  It may work with a 386.

  The library is tied to Linux and will not work on BSD or HERD.

Documentation
-------------

  The library call descriptions are in file asmlibx.txt.
  The demo programs might be the easiest way to see how it works.

  Basically, a window is created by calling: window_pre
                                             window_create

  Then writing to the window                 window_write_line

  The window colors and fonts can be changed by:
                                             window_color
                                             window_font
