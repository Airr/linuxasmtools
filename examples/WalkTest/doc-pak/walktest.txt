OPERATION

   The one mile walk can be on any level one mile
   streach.  Most highschool tracks are a quater
   mile and make ideal way to measure a mile.
   
   Measuring the after walk pulse can be simply
   counting a pulse for 10 seconds and multiplying
   by 6.  A easier way is to use one of the many
   electronic pulse measures.  These are built into
   some watches.  Also, some pluse measures are
   part of stop watches and monitor pulse constantly.
   
   After completing the mile walk, your pulse will
   slow quickly and return to its resting state.  To
   check this it is useful to take the resting pulse
   before starting.

   this is sometimes refered to as MET or VO2max.
   MET is short for "metabolic equivalent tasks"
   
   The rating data is taken from National Institute
