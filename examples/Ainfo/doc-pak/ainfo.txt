NAME
    Ainfo - view .info files by wrapping "info" program
          Ainfo provides a simple interface to view
          .info format files.  

INPUTS
    usage: ainfo <in-file>
    The input file must be in .info format as
    recognized by the "info" executable.     

OUTPUT
    none

NOTES
   source file:  ainfo.asm
    
   Ainfo calls the library function sys_wrap to
   execute "info" and feed it keystrokes.  This
   allows the user interface to be modified and
   the keyboard redefined.

   The arrow keys now move to topics as follows:
   UP - move up to topic within page
   DOWN - move down to topic within page
   RIGHT - enter topic
   LEFT - return to previous topic

   PGDN - move down within page
   PGUP - move up with page
   ESC - exit (also "q" exits)

   Ainfo is called by AsmMgr to view .info files.
