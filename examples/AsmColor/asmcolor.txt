DESCRIPTION
    AsmColor supports AsmLib by showing colors and the
    code needed to create the color.  All colors displayed
    by AsmLib use this standard color encoding.

    asmlib expects color information to be stored
    in one dword as hex: dd xx--yyzz

    where: xx = color attribute
           yy = foreground color code
           zz = background color code

  foreground and background colors in hex are:
  30-blk 31-red 32-grn 33-brn 34-blu 35-purple 36-cyan 37-gry

  attributes in hex are:
  30-normal 31-bold 34-underscore 37-inverse
