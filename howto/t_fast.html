1.  Disclaimer<br>
<br>
  The following document is offered in good faith as comprising only<br>
  safe programming and procedures. No responsibility is accepted by the<br>
  author for any loss or damage caused in any way to any person or<br>
  equipment, as a direct or indirect consequence of following these<br>
  instructions.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.  Introduction<br>
<br>
  The most recent version of this document can always be found at<br>
  http://linuxasmtools.net<br>
<br>
  There has been a lot of interest in speeding up graphical<br>
  displays, but little discussion of text displays.  Generally,<br>
  text display speeds have been sufficient or a few design<br>
  changes can fix the problems.   Also, graphical applications<br>
  dominate much of the Linux world and their slow speed has<br>
  grabbed programmer attention.  Should we spend time speeding<br>
  up text displays?  This howto looks for some answers.<br>
<br>
3. What is the problem?<br>
<br>
  Is there a problem?  For most people the answer is: no!<br>
  The few that are having problems assume it is due to slow<br>
  hardware or something else. <br>
<br>
  The symptoms of text speed problems are:<br>
    * flickering displays<br>
    * flashing areas of screen that are too fast<br>
      to see.<br>
    * parts of display updating slowly<br>
    * And, the worst case, slow program execution.<br>
<br>
  These problems occur normally when a computer is under<br>
  heavy load, using older hardware, or running non-optimized<br>
  display handling.<br>
<br>
  It is difficult to know how may users have these<br>
  problems, it may be quite high.<br>
<br>
4. How do text displays work?<br>
<br>
  There are three main areas of text usage on Linux,<br>
  they are:<br>
<br>
   * X window text<br>
   * X terminal<br>
   * console<br>
<br>
  All text handling converts ASCII codes to a graphic<br>
  using font tables.  The resulting pixels are written<br>
  into display memory and a character appears.<br>
<br>
4.1 X window text displays<br>
<br>
  The X server talks directly to display memory and<br>
  all text handling is internal to the server.  It<br>
  is usually fast and of little interest to this howto.<br>
<br>
  Additionally, xlib includes some features<br>
  mentioned in this howto<br>
<br>
4.2 X terminal displays and console displays<br>
<br>
  Both X terminals and console displays use control<br>
  codes embedded with the text.  They must scan<br>
  the text for control codes such as line-feed,<br>
  cursor movement, color selection, and many others.<br>
  Once the control codes are processed, the remaining<br>
  ascii is converted to a graphic using font tables.<br>
<br>
  All this uses several layers of processing and may<br>
  be fertile ground for optimization.<br>
  <br>
5. What can we do?<br>
<br>
  If you look at the typical program, it builds a<br>
  line of data, sets the display color, moves the<br>
  cursor to start of line, and finally writes the<br>
  line.<br>
<br>
  We can save a little time by collecting all these<br>
  operations into one text string and writing<br>
  everything with one kernel call.<br>
<br>
  We could speed things up a little more by collecting<br>
  multiple lines and writing them all at once.<br>
<br>
  We could put the display in wrap mode, and eliminate<br>
  all the line-feed characters.<br>
<br>
  We could track display location and color and only<br>
  output control strings if a change occurs.<br>
<br>
  We could keep track of what is already on the display<br>
  and only send data if a area is changed.<br>
<br>
  We could sort the data by display location and<br>
  output data in sequence.<br>
<br>
  We could collect all writes and only send the<br>
  latest data for a area of the screen.<br>
<br>
  Would all these changes make a big difference?<br>
  For most programs that display a lot of text, they<br>
  will make a huge difference.  Generally, programmers<br>
  focus on their application and not on display<br>
  optimization.  This means, the typical program<br>
  has slow display logic.<br>
<br>
  Isn't this too complicated for programmers to<br>
  worry about?  It is complicated, but programmers<br>
  don't need to worry about it.  Instead, all we<br>
  need is a display handler to do it for us.<br>
<br>
  The design we need is a cache (image of display)<br>
  that can be read or written like a disk drive.<br>
  This provides a series of additional advantages:<br>
<br>
   * reading of data and colors from display<br>
   * functions better matched to most applications.<br>
   * ability to detect data that has not changed<br>
     and does not need display update.<br>
<br>
  The cache works by keeping a copy of each display<br>
  character and its color.  Each character and<br>
  color also has a flag which is set when the<br>
  they are not in sync with display contents.<br>
<br>
  When a write request comes in the data is<br>
  compared to image contents and flags are<br>
  set only if the data will change the display.<br>
  The color is also tracked and if it changes,<br>
  the flags are set to force a display update.  <br>
  <br>
6. What solutions are available?<br>
<br>
   The library asmliba provides all the features<br>
   discussed in this howto and also includes a<br>
   keyboard cache.  See section 7<br>
<br>
   The AsmLiba_tutor has some example code and<br>
   introduces the cache functions.<br>
   <br>
   The X server is usually called from xlib and it<br>
   has a function cache.<br>
