2005-11-02  The upper right corner date display
  was incorrect.  The poblem was fixed by changing
  raw2seconds.asm to clear the time.zo field.  It had
  garbage that was corrupting the calcuations for UTC
  mode.

2005-12-18  The home path was not found it the environment
  had an entry like: xxx_HOME=yyyy.  The library call
  env_home was changed to only recognize: HOME=yyyy and
  verify no data is infront of HOME.

2005-12-20 When switching projects with mouse click, the
  current page display pointer was not reset.  This
  caused garbage on display.  Fixed, by setting
  display_top_line to fbuf

2006-06-13
  Changed install to avoid writing to user area.  Sometimes
  this goes to root instead.  The executable now creates
  files in user area  /home/xxxx/.asmplan/plan
