1-06-2007 Changed code hunt to start at elf_phys_code_start
          rather than elf_phys_exec_entry.  This picks up some
          move code above EIP that was messing up the scroll
          up and down of window.  The window uses body bits to
          find previous line when centering EIP.

11-10-2007 Enhanced calculator to use any combination of label,
         operator, value, register
